I used different dynamic type checking implementations for checking whether an object was a class (which was simply a linear search through the linked list of class/superclass relations) or had an interface (which was simplified by copying the interface records from superclasses into their subclasses' type information, so turned into a search of a sorted array). We never had to do a graph search of any kind, and am kind-of surprised that you did.  Were you attempting to treat interfaces and classes uniformly?"

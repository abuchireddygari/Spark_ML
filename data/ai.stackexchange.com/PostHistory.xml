Once we are able to build an AI AI researcher (that is, a computer that knows how to make computers better at thinking), the economic and military relevance of humans will rapidly disappear as any decision that could be made by a human could be made better by a computer.

And this formula the second machine will not be able to produce as being true, while a mind will be able to see that it is true. And if now a third machine is constructed, able to do what the second machine was unable to do, exactly the same will happen: there will be yet a third formula, the Gödelian formula for the formal system corresponding to the third machine's scheme of operations, which the third machine is unable to produce as being true, while a mind will still be able to see that it is true.

However, there's indeed a bias towards them in practice. Although most functional languages are impure (that is, they allow side effects), and such can't count as &quot;declarative&quot;, a few languages are purely functional (that is, they don't allow side effects), most prominently [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Functional_programming). Purity is key here. In Haskell, [even I/O is pure](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4066401/5249858).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key difference between imperative languages and (purely) functional languages is in the way they describe the program. An imperative program describes *how* to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe *what* is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, &quot;function&quot; is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function's arguments. That is, the function's output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as [referential transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency). Referential transparency states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where `ϕ` is the set of all functions, and `δ(f)` is `f`'s domain. For the typical imperative language's definition of &quot;function&quot;, the above doesn't hold. For instance, C's `getchar()` does not always return the same value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is 3. First, in mathematical notation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where `G(n, s)` is the set of the lesser `n`th elements from `s`. In mathematics, you don't worry about how is the set `S` supposed to be computed, but rather about `S`'s definition itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, in Python (in imperative style):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def is_prime(n):&#xD;&#xA;      for x in range(2, n):&#xD;&#xA;        if n % x == 0:&#xD;&#xA;          return False&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      return True&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def foo():&#xD;&#xA;      s = set()&#xD;&#xA;      n = 2&#xD;&#xA;      while len(s) &lt; 10:&#xD;&#xA;        if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:&#xD;&#xA;           s.append(n)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      return set(s)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there's an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don't use it, it's our fault, not Python's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Haskell steps in:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    import qualified Data.Set as Set&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    isPrime :: Integer -&gt; Bool&#xD;&#xA;    isPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    s = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haskell's version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the `isPrime` function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, `s` (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute `s` itself. The compiler, more often than not [The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/) (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm. GHC's optimizer is known to be one of the strongest in the world, not because its the best compiler of 'em all, but because Haskell's nature allows for this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Haskell (and other functional languages), in summary, have several features that make it look, taste, and behave like pure math:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Referential transparency and purity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Haskell is lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [A **very** strong type system](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/279316/what-exactly-makes-the-haskell-type-system-so-revered-vs-say-java), with such exotic (but very useful!) stuff as [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type) (and [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type)) data types.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the bottom line is that AI researchers often prefer functional languages over imperative languages (or, more assertively, pure over impure languages), because they are attempting to *define* artificial intelligence itself, by means of functions (relationship between an input and an output). At the end, we do this because we have no real algorithm for human-level intelligence to raise from a handful of transistors. Also, there's been a historical bias towards these kind of languages, starting with [John McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)), Lisp's creator and a pioneer in early AI research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ssAGM.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/F94i9.png" />

It holds conveniently in practice, but the terms come from elsewhere. In 1980, [John Searle][1] coined the following statements:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - AI hypothesis, strong form: an AI system can _think_ and have a _mind_ (in the philosophical definition of the term);&#xD;&#xA; - AI hypothesis, weak form: an AI system can only _act_ like it thinks and has a mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So _strong AI_ is a shortcut for an AI systems that verifies the _strong AI hypothesis_. Similarly, for the weak form. The terms have then evolved: strong AI refers to AI that performs as well as humans (who have minds), weak AI refers to AI that doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with these definitions is that they're fuzzy. For example, [AlphaGo][2] is an example of weak AI, but is &quot;strong&quot; by Go-playing standards. A hypothetical AI replicating a human baby would be a strong AI, while being &quot;weak&quot; at most tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other terms exist: [Artificial General Intelligence][3] (AGI), which has cross-domain capability (like humans), can learn from a wide range of experiences (like humans), among other features.

If there are too much iterations, your model will become too specific about training samples and will score less using other samples that are not seen during the training phase. This is call over-fitting, though over-fitting is not specific to iterative learning methods.&#xA;&#xA;One solution to prevent over-fitting in these iterative learning algorithms is early stopping. Normally a control group of samples called validation samples (validation set) are used to validate the model and notify when it starts to over-fit. The validation set is not used by the training algorithm however its corresponding outputs are known and after each iteration its samples are employed to measure how good the model currently works. As soon as the performance on the validation set stops to grow and starts to drop we stop iterating the training algorithm. This is called early stopping which can help to maximize the generalization power of our learned model.&#xA;&#xA;Note that if we use the training set itself for validation the performance will always increase because that is what the learning algorithm is designed to do. However the learning algorithm does not know how specific it should be about the training set that is why we need methods like early stopping." />

There is still momentum due to so many people using it in the past, who are still active in the industry or research (anecdote: the last VCR was produced by a Japanese maker in July 2016, yes). The language is however used (to my knowledge) for the kind of AI that does not leverage Machine Learning, typically as the reference books from Russell and Norvig. These applications are still very useful, but Machine Learning gets all the steam these days.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another reason for the decline is that LISP practitioners have partially moved to Clojure and other recent languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are learning about AI technologies, LISP (or Scheme or Prolog) is good choice to understand what is going on with &quot;AI&quot; at large. But if you wish or have to be very pragmatic, Python or R are the community choices&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: The above lacks concrete example and reference. I am aware of some work in universities, and some companies inspired by or directly using LISP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To add on @Harsh's answer, LISP (and Scheme, and Prolog) has qualities that made it look like it was better suited for creating intelligent mechanisms---making AI as perceived in the 60s.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the qualities was that the language design leads the developer to think in a quite elegant way, to decompose a big problem into small problems, etc. Quite &quot;clever&quot;, or &quot;intelligent&quot; if you will. Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and &quot;purely functional&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the [Situation Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus), where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a &quot;world&quot;, and can let it evolve to compute *situations*---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the [frame problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem), meaning this calculus cannot tell what does *not* change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP's fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)). So the language choice burns down to pragmatism." />

I will address the question in the title. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The halting problem is an example of a general phenomenon known as [Undecidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem), which shows that there are problems no Turing machine can solve in finite time. Let's consider the generalization that it is undecidable whether a Turing Machine satisfies some non-trivial property P, called [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First note that the halting problem applies only if the Turing machine takes arbitrarily long input. If the input is bounded, it is possible to enumerate all possible cases and the problem is no longer undecidable. It might still be inefficient to calculate it, but then we are turning to the complexity theory, which should be a separate question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rice's theorem implies that an intelligence (a human) cannot be able to determine whether another intelligence (such as an AGI) possesses a certain property, such as being [friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence). This does not mean that we cannot design a Friendly AGI, but it does mean that we cannot check whether an arbitrary AGI is friendly. So, while we can possibly create an AI which is guaranteed to be friendly, we also need to ensure that IT cannot create another AI which is unfriendly. " />

In the eyes themselves, photons are detected by light-sensitive cells and added together to make what are essentially the color elements of pixels. Those are then routed to another layer which does something like edge detection, and then the next layer does something like shape detection, and so on up to higher level concepts like &quot;a cat's face.' If LSD lowers the activation threshold for those neurons, or makes them more excitable, then more things will be interpreted as having the higher level concept (and so a patch of rough texture may have a face jump out of it, for example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way that CNN &quot;deep dreaming' works is that the base image is amplified. That is, to make a particular patch look more like a dog, the shapes are nudged to be more dog-like, and the shapes nudge the edges, and the edges nudge the pixels." />

Example: &#xD;&#xA; * States = {*sleep*, *eat*, *walk*, *work*}&#xD;&#xA; * Model 1: Most probable sequence on weekdays, say: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → work → work → eat → walk → sleep  → sleep&#xD;&#xA; * Model 2: Most probable sequence on weekends, some: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → eat → walk → sleep → sleep&#xD;&#xA; * New data arrives: Which sequence is more probable that it came from? Check model 1, check model 2. Which fits better? → Assign&#xD;&#xA;* Note that the previous example is oversimplified. Also note that a *unit time* is needed there (other than letters / words, for instance).&#xD;&#xA;* You can *nest* Markov models. That means that you generate a model (a set of probabilities for all the states) in a &quot;lower scale&quot; and then use it in a more abstract model. For example, you can nest your day-scale model to a month or year (to include holidays, for instance).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also [see this link for a nice introduction](http://blog.wolfram.com/2013/02/04/centennial-of-markov-chains/) and [some posts in crossvalidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mcmc?sort=votes&amp;pageSize=50).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the question if artificial intelligence can be created by using this kind of methods, my personal (easy) answer would be **no**, because they only relate data and probabilities and thus belong more to the statistics and machine learning branch. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A longer answer needs to take into account the [weak vs. strong AI question](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/74/what-is-the-difference-between-strong-ai-and-weak-ai)." />

If there are too much iterations, your model will become too specifically trained for the training samples and will score less on other samples that are not seen during the training phase. This is call over-fitting, though over-fitting is not specific to iterative learning methods.&#xA;&#xA;One solution to prevent over-fitting in these iterative learning algorithms is early stopping. Normally a control group of samples called validation samples (validation set) are used to validate the model and notify when it starts to over-fit. The validation set is not used by the training algorithm however its corresponding outputs are known and after each iteration its samples are employed to measure how good the model currently works. As soon as the performance on the validation set stops to grow and starts to drop we stop iterating the training algorithm. This is called early stopping which can help to maximize the generalization power of our learned model.&#xA;&#xA;Note that if we use the training set itself for validation the performance will always increase because that is what the learning algorithm is designed to do. However the learning algorithm does not know how specifically it should learn the training set and that is why we need methods like early stopping." />

Boolean logic means you are working with truth values of either true or false (or 1 or 0 if you prefer). Fuzzy logic is the same apart from you can have truth values which are in-between true and false, that is to say you are working with any number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). The fact that you can have a 'partially true and partially false' truth value is where the word &quot;fuzzy&quot; comes from.

Text="'Direct augmentation' of human intelligence, of the sort that you would see in science fiction, looks to be very hard. Most of our promising approaches deal with *avoiding damage* rather than *adding capabilities*--there's no drug that you can take now that will make you smarter to the degree that missing a night of sleep can make you dumber.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most informative area of current practice is probably game-playing, where '[centaurs](http://bloomreach.com/2014/12/centaur-chess-brings-best-humans-machines/),' or humans working with computers, outcompete human players or computer players.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But a centaur player doesn't have a wire jutting out of their skull to jack into the computer; they're looking at a laptop screen. One of the reasons to be pessimistic about cyborg augmentation is because current I/O technology is already so good. Why install a new wire to put information into your visual cortex, when you come already equipped with two? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you could think code directly onto the screen, how much better would that be than typing code through a keyboard? Probably some, but I find it difficult to imagine that it'll be more than twice as good. So most human-computer intelligence augmentation will look like people using software, and software using human inputs, rather than humans and computers evolving together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) and similar approaches cause temporary changes in mental abilities by raising or lowering the activation potentials of neurons in particular regions of the brain. (I've done it myself, a few years ago, and what weak effects I noticed were probably negative. Not too much surprise for a DIY setup!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It looks like it has a number of useful implications. One article about TDCS that I found particularly striking was the journalist who tried it gushing about how their anxiety disappeared for a few days, presumably because the part of their brain behind the anxiety was dampened. One could imagine it being useful for the treatment of many different mental disorders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I'm pessimistic that it will translate into superior *peak* performance, and I think that's the sort of thing that's more relevant for discussions of augmentation. (Is there TDCS that we could do that would make Terrence Tao better at doing mathematics?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where improved AI methods will come into play is by improving our models of the brain, allowing us to better target interventions, much in the way that AI methods are improving our treatment of cancer (through superior diagnosis and targeting of radiotherapy, as two easy examples). These effects will all be indirect--for example, AI empowering an app or gadget that helps you sleep better won't *directly* augment your intelligence, but will cause population-level increases in effective intelligence through reducing sleep deprivation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't talked yet about nootropics, chemicals that increase intelligence, but it's reasonable to expect that AI will improve drug discovery there like it improves drug discovery for anything else. But the same caveats apply--the effect of nootropics seem to be negatively correlated with intelligence (that is, the smarter someone already is, the harder it is to increase their intelligence further)." />

As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who for genetic reasons will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the **initial generation**, a population composed of different **individuals** is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called **fitness**, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An individual is coded as a **genotype**, which can have any shape, such as a** bit vector (**genetic algorithms**) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a **phenotype** when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called **direct** **coding**. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 01010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the transition from the old to the new generation are called **variation** **operators**, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals. There are two distinct types of variation operators:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* the **mutation** **operators**, which are used to introduce variations within the same individual, as genetic mutations;&#xD;&#xA;* the **crossover** **operators**, which are used to cross at least two different genotypes, as genetic crosses from breeding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Evolutionary algorithms have proven themselves in various fields such as operations research, robotics, biology, nuance, or cryptography. In addition, they can optimize multiple objectives simultaneously and can be used as black boxes because they do not assume any properties in the mathematical model to optimize. Their only real limitation is the computational complexity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wweBO.png" />

To evolve images, both the directly encoded and indirectly encoded images, we use the [Sferes](https://github.com/jbmouret/sferes2) evolutionary framework. The entire code base to conduct the evolutionary experiments can be download [sic] [here](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling). The code for the images produced by gradient ascent is available [here](https://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/fooling/tree/master/caffe/ascent).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Images that are actually random junk were correctly recognized as nothing meaningful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In response to an unrecognizable image, the networks could have output a low confidence for each of the 1000 classes, instead of an extremely high confidence value for one of the classes. In fact, they do just that for randomly generated images (e.g. those in generation 0 of the evolutionary run)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The original goal of the researchers was to use the neural networks to automatically generate images that look like the real things (by getting the recognizer's feedback and trying to change the image to get a more confident result), but they ended up creating the above art. Notice how even in the static-like images there are little splotches - usually near the center - which, it's fair to say, are triggering the recognition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We were not trying to produce adversarial, unrecognizable images. Instead, we were trying to produce recognizable images, but these unrecognizable images emerged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Evidently, these images had just the right distinguishing features to match what the AI looked for in pictures. The &quot;paddle&quot; image does have a paddle-like shape, the &quot;bagel&quot; is round and the right color, the &quot;projector&quot; image is a camera-lens-like thing, the &quot;computer keyboard&quot; is a bunch of rectangles (like the individual keys), and the &quot;chainlink fence&quot; legitimately looks like a chain-link fence to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Figure 8. Evolving images to match DNN classes produces a tremendous diversity of images. Shown are images selected to showcase diversity from 5 evolutionary runs. The diversity suggests that the images are non-random, but that instead evolutions producing [sic] discriminative features of each target class.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading: [the original paper](http://www.evolvingai.org/files/DNNsEasilyFooled_cvpr15.pdf) (large PDF)" />

Let's consider the generalization that it is undecidable whether a Turing Machine satisfies some non-trivial property P, called [Rice's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First note that the halting problem applies only if the Turing machine takes arbitrarily long input. If the input is bounded, it is possible to enumerate all possible cases and the problem is no longer undecidable. It might still be inefficient to calculate it, but then we are turning to the complexity theory, which should be a separate question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rice's theorem implies that an intelligence (a human) cannot be able to determine whether another intelligence (such as an AGI) possesses a certain property, such as being [friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence).

Text="The following thread has many answers regarding why LISP used to be thought of as the AI language: [Why is Lisp used for AI][1] and the following is an answer by Peter Norvig, who wrote a popular textbook on the subject and is currently Director of Research at Google: [Is it true that Lisp is highly used programming language in AI?][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not overly familiar with the history, but I think LISP was oversold to industry as &quot;the AI language&quot;. It is a good language for humans to think in and pioneered many important ideas which have since been incorporated into many modern languages (see [the Wikipedia page][3]), but it is no way the &quot;best&quot;. It was likely also popular because it is very expressive: you can write short programs to represent complex ideas, a property it shares with other functional languages in use such as Scala. This also means that it is easy to write a program that is very hard to debug in LISP. Modern functional languages have been trying to do better in this regard through typing etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The paradigm for AI that currently receives most attention is Machine Learning, i.e. learning hypothesis from data, as opposed to previous approaches like Expert Systems where experts wrote rules for the AI to follow. Python is currently the most widely used language for prototyping machine learning algorithms and has many libraries and an active community. Another important detail about modern AI is the volume of data it uses. Big Data analysis is done using cluster computing systems like Hadoop (with code written in Java) and Spark (with code written in Python or Scala). Often, the core time-intensive subroutines are written in C, but this is often done in the form of third-party libraries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally it must be said that the AI Winter of the 80s was not because we did not have the right language, but because we did not have the right algorithms and did not have enough computational power. This has changed as GPUs have gotten better. If you're trying to learn AI, spend your time studying algorithms and not languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/130475/why-is-lisp-used-for-ai&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Lisp-is-highly-used-programming-language-in-AI&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" />

It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is designed to emphasize usability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages such as [tag:C], and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two similar but incompatible versions of Python are in widespread use (2 and 3). Please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using when asking a question about Python.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of [tag:Scheme], [tag:Ruby], [tag:Perl] and [tag:Tcl].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like other [dynamic languages][4], Python is often used as a [scripting language][5], but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[tag:CPython], the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in [*The Zen of Python*][6] written by Tim Peters, which can be revealed by issuing this command at the interactive interpreter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt;&gt;&gt; import this&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The documentation can also be accessed offline for your installation of Python in the following manner:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Going into `Your_Python_install_dir/Doc`. There is a complete Python documentation present for the version of Python installed on your computer.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Running `pydoc x` or `python -m pydoc x` from the command prompt or terminal displays documentation for module `x`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike many other languages Python uses an indentation based syntax and this may take some getting used to for programmers familiar with braces for syntax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import braces&#xD;&#xA;      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1&#xD;&#xA;    SyntaxError: not a chance&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To help with the transition it is a recommendation to use a properly configured text-editor created for programmers or an IDE. Python comes with a basic IDE called [IDLE][7] to get you started. Other popular examples are the charity-ware [tag:vim], the free GNU [tag:Emacs], [tag:Eclipse]+[tag:PyDev] or [tag:PyCharm]. Take a look at this [IDE comparison list][8] for many other alternatives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;## Tagging recommendation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Use the [tag:python] tag for all Python related questions. If you believe your question includes issues specific to individual versions, use [tag:python-3.x] or [tag:python-2.7] in addition to the main [tag:python] tag. If you believe your question may be even more specific, you can include a version specific tag such as [tag:python-3.5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, consider including the tag for the specific implementation if you are using one other than [tag:CPython] - the use of [tag:CPython] is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;## References&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Official documentation for the current stable versions: [2.7.x][9] and [3.5.x][10].&#xD;&#xA;- Release notes for the current stable versions: [2.7.11][11] and [3.5.1][12].&#xD;&#xA;- [Python (programming language)][13] (Wikipedia)&#xD;&#xA;- [Python for Programmers][14]&#xD;&#xA;- [Python - Quick Guide][15]&#xD;&#xA;- [Getting started with Python][16]&#xD;&#xA;- [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3][17]&#xD;&#xA;- The non-profit [Python Software Foundation][18] manages [CPython][19].&#xD;&#xA;- [PSF][18] License Agreement for Python [2.7.x][20] and [3.5.x][21]&#xD;&#xA;- [Stackoverflow Documentation][72]&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;## Popular [web frameworks][22] based on Python&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your question has to do with any of these frameworks, please ensure you include the appropriate tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [**Django**][23] [tag:django]&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    The Web framework for perfectionists (with deadlines). Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

A supercomputer larger than that 37 petaflop estimate [exists today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But emulation is hard. See [this SO question about hardware emulation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/471973/what-makes-building-game-console-emulators-so-hard) or [this article](http://www.tested.com/tech/gaming/2712-why-perfect-hardware-snes-emulation-requires-a-3ghz-cpu/) on emulating the SNES, in which they require **140 times** the processing power of the SNES chip to get it right. [This 2013 article](http://gizmodo.com/an-83-000-processor-supercomputer-only-matched-one-perc-1045026757) claims that a second of human brain activity took 40 minutes to emulate on a 10 petaflop computer (a *2400-times* slowdown, not the 4-times slowdown one might naively expect).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And all this assumes that neurons are relatively simple objects! It could be that the amount of math we have to do to model a single neuron is actually much more than the flops estimate above. Or it could be the case that dramatic simplifications can be made, and if we knew what the brain was actually trying to accomplish we could do it much more cleanly and simply. (One advantage that ANNs have, for example, is that they are doing computations with much more precision than we expect biological neurons to have.

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being *instantly* rejected from any top-tier journal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Crossover functions are easy to define and natural**: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xD;&#xA;- This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&#xD;&#xA; - **Black Box evaluation**: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xD;&#xA;- **Exception: Simulations**. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. [modelling locomotion patterns][1]. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. [PDE constrained optimization][2], so this may change in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not Appropriate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - **You can calculate a gradient** for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &#xD;&#xA;  - **You know the fitness function in closed form**: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting [automatic differentiation][3]. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use [subgradient descent][4].&#xD;&#xA;  - Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a **linear program or a quadratic program**: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &#xD;&#xA;  - **Your solution space is small**: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies. I am biased towards [CMA-ES][5], which I think is a good simple algorithm that captures the notion of a gradient in the fitness landscape in a way that traditional GAs do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES" />

Humankind would be unable to predict any future events, or explain any present events, as science itself becomes incapable of describing machine-triggered events. Essentially, machines would think of us the same way we think of ants. Thus, we can make no predictions past the singularity. Furthermore, as a logical consequence, we'ld be unable to define the point at which the singularity may occur at all, or even recognize it when it happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in order for the singularity to take place, AGI needs to be developed, and [whether that is possible is quite a hot debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Feasibility) right now. Moreover, an algorithm that creates superhuman intelligence out of bits and bytes would have to be designed. By definition, a human programmer wouldn't be able to do such a thing, as his/her brain would need to be able to comprehend concepts beyond its range. There is also the argument that an intelligence explosion (the mechanism by which a technological singularity would theoretically be formed) would be impossible due to the difficulty of the design challenge of making itself more intelligent, getting larger proportionally to its intelligence, and that the difficulty of the design itself may overtake the intelligence required to solve said challenge (last point credit to `god of llamas` in the comments).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are related theories involving machines taking over humankind and all of that sci-fi narrative.

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being *instantly* rejected from any top-tier journal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Crossover functions are easy to define and natural**: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xD;&#xA;- This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&#xD;&#xA; - **Black Box evaluation**: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xD;&#xA;- **Exception: Simulations**. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. [modelling locomotion patterns][1]. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. [PDE constrained optimization][2], so this may change in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not Appropriate:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  - **You can calculate a gradient** for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &#xD;&#xA;  - **You know the fitness function in closed form**: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting [automatic differentiation][3], so you don't even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use [subgradient descent][4].&#xD;&#xA;  - Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a **linear program or a quadratic program**: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &#xD;&#xA;  - **Your solution space is small**: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies. I am biased towards [CMA-ES][5], which I think is a good simple algorithm that captures the notion of a gradient in the fitness landscape in a way that traditional GAs do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES" />

The reason to do this is to make the influence of confounders independent from the influence of the factor under investigation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But randomness only works for this *in expectation*. If we actually knew what the confounders were, we could do a paired assignment (or a similar scheme) that ensured the various groups were matched *as well as possible*, instead of us just not knowing ahead of time which way the bias went.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some cases where pseudorandomness, rather than full randomness, will impair training AI designs. A simple example would be a case where you want to randomly initialize weights in a network where the number of parameters exceeds the periodicity of the RNG; this means that while you have as many possible networks as there are possible unique seeds, you can't actually visit the entire weight space that you wanted to sample over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think any of those cases are limiting factors, however.

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xD;&#xA;his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xD;&#xA;winds up pregnant by Buck. She has the baby but doesn't want it, and so, aided&#xD;&#xA;by her husband, she drowns the baby in a river, thus &quot;neatly solving &quot;the problem&quot;&#xD;&#xA;of Bambi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This story is presented to ACME in the following form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ql: (neglectful-husband (Sluggo))&#xD;&#xA;    q2: (lonely-and-sex-starved-wife (Jane-Doe))&#xD;&#xA;    q3: (macho-ladykiller (Buck-Stag))&#xD;&#xA;    q4: (poor-innocent-little-fetus (Bambi))&#xD;&#xA;    q5: (takes-out-to-local-bar (Sluggo Jane-Doe Buck-Stag))&#xD;&#xA;    ...&#xD;&#xA;    q11: (neatly-solves-the-problem-of (Jane-Doe Bambi))&#xD;&#xA;    q12: (cause (ql0 q11))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose the program were to be asked if Jane Doe's behavior was moral. Complex compound emotional concepts such as 'neglectful', 'lonely' and 'innocent' are here simply predicates, not available to the AI for deeper introspective examination. They could just as easily be replaced by labels such as as 'bling-blang -blong'. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in one sense, the absence of success at an EQ depth with any depth is indicative of the general problem currently facing AI: the inability to define (or otherwise learn) meaningful representations of subtle complexities of the human world, which is a lot more complex than being able to recognize videos of cats." />

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xD;&#xA;his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xD;&#xA;winds up pregnant by Buck.

Complex compound emotional concepts such as 'neglectful', 'lonely' and 'innocent' are here simply predicates, not available to the AI for deeper introspective examination. They could just as easily be replaced by labels such as as 'bling-blang-blong15657'. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in one sense, the absence of success at an EQ depth with any depth is indicative of the general problem currently facing AI: the inability to define (or otherwise learn) meaningful representations of subtle complexities of the human world, which is a lot more complex than being able to recognize videos of cats." />

Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called [Monte Carlo Tree Search][3]. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won't be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point. Then you can use the results of that simulation to get a better idea of how good that specific sequence of moves really is and you update the tree accordingly. Repeat as needed until you find a good move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want more information or to look at some illustrations, I found an interesting paper on the topic: C.

That is, [subsumption architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture) is one in which the 'autopilot' is *replaced* by a more sophisticated system when necessary. (All pieces receive the raw sensory inputs, and output actions, some of which turn off or on other systems.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But a better approach is the normal hierarchical control approach, in which the target of a lower level system is the output of a higher level system. That is, the targeted joint angle of a robot leg is determined by the system that is trying to optimize the velocity, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the trajectory, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the target position, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This allows for increasing level of complexity while maintaining detail and system reusability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I don't think you actually need what one would naively call 'embodied cognition' in order to get the bottom-up hierarchy of competencies that Brooks is right to point towards. The core feature is the wide array of inputs and outputs, which are understood in a hierarchical fashion that allows systems to be chained together vertically. I think you could get a functional general intelligence whose only inputs and outputs involve going through an Ethernet cable, and doesn't have anything like a traditional body that it actuates or senses through. (This is a claim that the hierarchical structure is what matters, not the content of what we use that structure for.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(The main place to look for more, I think, is actually a book about *human* cognition, called The Control of Perception by William T. Powers.)" />

This is very different to how humans learn by creating concepts, relationship, common sense reasoning which gives ability to learn much without too much data. Therefore machine learning with common-sense reasoning capabilities should be researched further more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Decision techniques.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Current AI-based systems have very limited ability for making decisions, therefore new techniques must be developed (e.g. modeling systemic risks, analyzing tradeoffs, detecting anomalies in context, analyzing data while preserving privacy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Domain-specific AI systems.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The current AI-based system is lack of abilities to understand the variety of domains of human expertise (such as medicine, engineering, law and many more). The systems should be able to perform professional-level tasks such as designing problems, experiments, managing contradictions, negotiating, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Data assurance and trust.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The current AI-based systems require huge amounts of data and their behaviour directly depends on the quality of this data which can be biased, incomplete or compromised. This can be expensive and time consuming especially where it is used for safety critical systems which potentially can be very dangerous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Radically efficient computing infrastructure.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The current AI-based systems require unprecedented workloads and computing power which require development of new computing architectures (such as neuromorphic).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Interpretability and explanations.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  For people to follow AI suggestions, they need to trust systems, and this is only when they are capable of knowing users' intents, priorities, reasoning and they can learn from their mistakes. These capabilities are required in many business domains and professionals&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Value alignment and ethics.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Humans can share the common knowledge of how the world function, the machine cannot. They can fail by having unintended and unexpected behaviour only because humans did not specify the right goals for them or them omitted essential training details. The systems should be able to correct specification of the goals and avoid unintended and undesired consequences in the behaviour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Social AI.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The AI-based systems should be able to work closely to humans in their professional and personal life, therefore they should have significant social capabilities, because they can impact on our emotions and our decision making capabilities. Also sophisticated natural language capabilities will need to be developed to allow a natural interaction and dialog between humans and machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: [Fundamental questions in AI research, and the most important research gaps (RFI questions 5 and 6)][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/rfi-preparing-future-artificial-intelligence&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/ostp/document4.shtml" />

In other words, even CNs have a hard time generalizing too far *beyond* what they learned from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The recognition limit is hard to define precisely.

I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact *directly*. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones *add up*, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get &quot;together as they move&quot;, forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the &quot;field-based motion coordination model&quot; (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other's field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple &quot;logic&quot; code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my *dating* knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from [Mamei and Zambonelli](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena), as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by [Weyns et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems). Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often *simple* and *resilient*: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually *slow*, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen. It would be better to endow robots with radars, sonars or other proximity sensors to implement stigmergic models. One related example is the decision by Tesla to add radars to its cars, instead of assuming reliable transponders on the road (*note*: This is just a parallel; there is no official relation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other implementations and related models are, for example, tuple-based coordination languages such as [Linda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)), and network protocols like [Chord](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf). As you see, these works are not necessarily in the &quot;AI domain&quot;." />

Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• a must create an artifact o of type t;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xD;&#xA;any criterion expressible in natural language;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xD;&#xA;that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;• a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xD;&#xA;to not be unrealistic for an average human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to *compare* the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result)." />

However, computers can now defeat grandmasters at chess, and people are no longer saying that it is a form of intelligence. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have OCR.

However, computers can now defeat grandmasters at chess, and people are no longer saying that it is a form of intelligence. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have OCR. It's already stated in [another answer](http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/1402/66) that our methods do not have the recognition facilities of a 5 year old.

Computer Science), and implementation to Software Engineering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's take a concrete example, really outside of AI: Find the minimum value of a given polynomial, if it exists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Mathematician will derivate the polynomial, find the zeros, and checkout convexity to find a minimum (if there is any zero). This procedure is very standard---some will say straightforward. It relies on a body of knowledge and an abstraction level that is appropriate for manual proof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Software Engineer approach is actually way longer to explain, and I am going to skip it. The point is that the body of knowledge is related but different: We have to find now a step-by-step procedure for the computer to achieve the result. The Mathematician one could be implemented directly in MathLab, almost verbatim, but we *assume* MathLab. And to build MathLab, we are back to the problem of making a procedure the computer can execute. We could for example base a procedure on Euler's method to find roots (a &quot;simple&quot; approach that closes on roots step after step), etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simple mathematical operations can be quite complex to implement on a computer. Perhaps the most famous is [random-number generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation). Mathematically, the concept is pure and clear. Generating an actual random-number is more elusive than it looks, to the point it calls for new *models* and new *implementations*...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A concrete example from history: Neural networks. In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations)." />

[Here's](https://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-defeats-alphago-masterful-comeback-game-4/) an article explaining it. Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that's surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what's the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But when there's a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays.

Each such agent implements a function&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learning as extending the reach of the designer into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the example you cite, &quot;autopilot for cars/planes&quot;, is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances.

There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular [neural net][3], through to probabilistic models like [bayesian networks (belief networks)][4] - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global-ebook/dp/9332543518/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network" />

The report also said that a human driver would have been unable to make the difference either. In other words, the car sensors (presumably camera) and the human eye could not have detected an obstacle, and could not have triggered any safety measure.

If we don't set things up correctly beforehand, we won't get a chance to fix it afterwards, because AI will have effective control.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are three main areas of discussion with regards to the Control Problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Whether or not the problem is urgent. Many AI experts, cognizant of the difficulty of getting simple systems to work effectively today, think that AI able to take control is not urgent, and as detail-minded engineers, they think it will be profoundly difficult to do any useful work today. (Andrew Ng, for example, famously called these sorts of worries like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.) Given radical uncertainty among AI experts as to when this will become an issue, however, this means we can't rule out rapid AI timescales, and should do at least some work in anticipation of those timescales.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Whether or not the problem is hard. Many people give short, simple, and wrong solutions to the control problem. Probably the most famous is the idea that intelligence and morality are inherently interlinked, and thus a more intelligent machine, *by definition*, will be more moral. The Orthogonality Thesis is the claim of the opposite, that intelligence and morality (or, more specifically, goal alignment) are unrelated things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. What foundations we can lay now. There are a bunch of open problems (see, for example, [MIRI's technical agenda](https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/)) that deal with mathematical logic of the sort that would be useful for ensuring robust value alignment, or on how to effectively do value learning (without giving an incentive to distort values), or on how to build value functions and goals such that they are fixable if they turn out to be mistaken. Those look like problems that we can do useful work on now, even without knowing what the actual structure of a future AI will look like." />

Examples might not be 100% accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data." />

Humankind would be unable to predict any future events, or explain any present events, as science itself becomes incapable of describing machine-triggered events. Essentially, machines would think of us the same way we think of ants. Thus, we can make no predictions past the singularity. Furthermore, as a logical consequence, we'd be unable to define the point at which the singularity may occur at all, or even recognize it when it happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in order for the singularity to take place, AGI needs to be developed, and [whether that is possible is quite a hot debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Feasibility) right now. Moreover, an algorithm that creates superhuman intelligence out of bits and bytes would have to be designed. By definition, a human programmer wouldn't be able to do such a thing, as his/her brain would need to be able to comprehend concepts beyond its range. There is also the argument that an intelligence explosion (the mechanism by which a technological singularity would theoretically be formed) would be impossible due to the difficulty of the design challenge of making itself more intelligent, getting larger proportionally to its intelligence, and that the difficulty of the design itself may overtake the intelligence required to solve said challenge (last point credit to [god of llamas](http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/47/god-of-llamas) in the comments).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are related theories involving machines taking over humankind and all of that sci-fi narrative.

Even if Asimov's laws were not enough, a series of constraints would still be necessary in order to avoid the misuse of AGI by misintentioned individuals, and Asimov's laws are the nearest we have to that." />

Text="Instead of talking about just SAT solvers, let me talk about optimization in general. Many economic problems can be cast as optimization problems: for example, FedEx may have a list of packages and the destinations for those packages, and must decide which packages to put on which trucks, and what order to deliver those packages in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you write out a mathematical description of this problem, there are a truly stunning number of possible solutions, and a well-defined way to evaluate which of two solutions is better. A solver is an algorithm that will evaluate a solution, come up with another solution, and then evaluate that one, and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In small cases and simple problems, the solver can also terminate with a proof that it is actually the best solution possible. But typically instead the solver just reports &quot;this is the best solution that I've seen,&quot; and that's used. An improvement in the solver means you can reliably get lower-cost solutions than you were seeing before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the SAT problem specifically, the Wikipedia page on [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) gives some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade[when?] and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).[1] Examples of such problems in electronic design automation (EDA) include formal equivalence checking, model checking, formal verification of pipelined microprocessors,[12] automatic test pattern generation, routing of FPGAs,[14] planning, and scheduling problems, and so on.

I believe it depends on specific countries and unions and how quickly we're able to advance and be ready for such change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To support above points and summarize the 'only self-driving cars' point, please see below references which shows that this is already happening:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 2014: [Uber will eventually replace all its drivers with self-driving cars][7]&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [Google's self-driving car system has been officially recognised as a driver in the US.][8]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; The move is seen as a first step towards changing the law for cars that have &quot;no need for a human driver&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [Beverly Hills to replace public transport with self-driving cars][9]&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [San Francisco pitches $149 million plan to replace cars with self-driving vehicles][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; San Francisco’s future is autonomous and shared vehicles – and that future may be only a decade away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 2016: [Otto Self-Driving Truck Company Wants to Replace Teamsters][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braking_distance&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/cz9yP.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.cyberphysics.co.uk/topics/forces/stopping_distance.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36823&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.slideshare.net/sbishop2/p22-car-design-safety&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_attack&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/28/5758734/uber-will-eventually-replace-all-its-drivers-with-self-driving-cars&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.dezeen.com/2016/02/12/google-self-driving-car-artficial-intelligence-system-recognised-as-driver-usa/&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/19/beverly-hills-replace-public-transport-driverless-cars-los-angeles/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/otto-selfdriving-truck-company-wants-to-replace-teamsters&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-pitches-149-million-plan-replace-cars-self-driving-vehicles/" />

That is, in Chess and Go both of us are looking at the same board.

To me, it feels a bit like *playing god*: Artificial (given) Intelligence would hence imply Artificial (given) Personality. This approach to the problem seems to be supported by the next fragment:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a notion of personality is useful&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I point to the above because I don't think that artificial intelligence... ***Intelligence*** itself, actually, need to be given or assigned, or even have a *use* in the sense of a *purpose*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The previous note** was about *emergence*, which is a topic that [user217281728](http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/42/user217281728) briefly addressed in [their answer](http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/1596/70). In this second approach, the particular traits *just happen*, or *develop*. The interaction between the (so-called) agents and their environment, as well as fellow agents can give place to new behaviour patterns, not designed beforehand. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In an evolutionary** approach, if the personality would happen to have an advantage (or at least not represent a disadvantage), then it could just appear. Of course, I am making a number of assumptions and demarcations here as well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* I am thinking about embodied intelligence&#xD;&#xA;* I speak of evolutionary robotics&#xD;&#xA;* I think on social issues being of importance&#xD;&#xA;* I assume that *personality* could emerge&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Now, an example** that I find extremely interesting is that of the little mobile robots which could move around and end-up in a pool of *food* or a pool of *poison*. And they, somehow, by some odd chance, recognised or made a relation between signals sent by other robots, and the presence of food. Or not. That was more or less the thing: Some robots (kind of) learned to *conceal* information and thus had more time to eat themselves. Well, I would have a couple of personality adjectives for such guys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here you find the article](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15786.full) and [here you find some videos](https://wp.unil.ch/mitrilab/) and related stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**And with that**, we land at my last point: [We humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism#In_computing) put the adjectives, according to our social conditioning. We call [Marvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)) *depressive* and [R2D2](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-do-we-love-r2-d2-and-not-c-3po-180951176/) lovely and charming. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If they perceive their personalities as constructive or damaging, will always depend on our own judgment. In the end, it is quite common under humans to disagree on personality issues, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bonus**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember when [HAL got emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkyrW2NiwM), on the face of death?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It gets *human* when it loses its cool, before the flawed-personality human astronaut :)" />

This is not optimal for Machine Learning, which works when we have a large pool of examples, and we don't know the ruleset; it will figure it out. Even if you were to train an Neural Network to process that input, there are several things you must account for:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1. Variance in data.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all webpages are equal in length or complexity, and making a neural network to generate output from HTML would produce garbage most of the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. Training time.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The time it would take for a neural network to understand HTML tags, attributes, the DOM Tree, and each and every element, including new ones being added every few years, and how each one renders and behaves, would take an extremely long time, most likely several years on a fast computer, if it even were possible&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. Interactivity.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Web pages aren't just static, they change according HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not only would you have to design your system to account for the rendering step, you would also make it have to understand the [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) scripting language [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), as well as the less complicated, but inherently intertwined with HTML, CSS stylesheet language. If you thought the rendering process was easy, try training a neural network to handle complicated scripting patterns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**4. New Standards**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not all HTML is equal, because of different standards. [WHATWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group) began working on HTML5 in 2004, and browsers started to implement not long after. In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it's standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible. Your system will never be as good as what hundreds of humans have optimized over 20 years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trying to solve HTML rendering with Neural Networks is akin to trying to nail a nail with a screwdriver. It's just not going to work&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope this was helpful!" />

Text="Tesla's technology is assistive, as Alexey points out, so this is not a case of an autonomous system (e.g. an AGI) doing some fatal stunt (the product name AutoPilot is famously misleading). Now on why the car assistance led to this tragic accident, there is some information related to AI technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;_Warning: I cannot find again the source critical to the next paragraph, and reading again pages over pages, I cannot find similar argument in other reports. I still remember vividly the point below, but please keep in mind it may be incorrect. The rest of the answer is weakly related, so I leave it all, with this warning._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An independent report (link needed, I can't find it...) explained that the assistive system was unable to detect the truck due to an exceptionally low contrast (bright sky perceived as white---colour of the truck). The report also said that a human driver would have been unable to make the difference either. In other words, it is possible that car sensors (presumably camera) and the human eye could not have detected an obstacle, and could not have triggered any safety measure. This [short graphical explanation](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/business/inside-tesla-accident.html) sums up the car sensors: Camera, radar, GPS, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The assistive sub-system is based on proprietary AI technologies. We can *only speculate* under some hypothesis. _This is not very useful, honestly, except for **illustration purpose**. Assuming the assistive system relies on ML technologies to learn about obstacles from a video stream (such systems do exist):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* It may be that the learning data was not &quot;good enough&quot; to cover the truck scenario.&#xD;&#xA;* It may be the technology was not powerful enough yet (lack generalization power, or simply too slow).&#xD;&#xA;* It may be a hardware problem, notably from the sensors: If the &quot;car's eyes&quot; are defective, the &quot;car's brain&quot; (the assistive system) is unable to react properly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why those technologies did not work in that case will remain a secret. We can say however that *any system*---whether built with AI technology or not---has limits. Beyond these limits, the system reaction is unpredictable: It could stop, reset, shutdown. The difficulty here is to define what a &quot;default behaviour&quot; is. A machine will basically do whatever it is designed to do, so an AI-based system too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could speculate even more on what would happen if the assistive system was really autonomous, the elusive AGI, but that is really not the case here." />

Probably every poster on here has experienced *greatly* misreading another individual emotionally. Further, people often don't act emotionally how they would expect themselves to act, for example we have all experienced frustration at someone else's irrational concerns and yet we are all guilty of holding irrational concerns of our own. This is the crux of why hard-coded emotional rules do not work - we do not have an understanding of what emotional 'rules' make someone feel real.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By moving towards autonomous state-based actors we move away from this issue. The actor's state transitions will of course be defined rules (hard-coded or learnt) but by abstracting the actor's emotional state from the specific context (e.g. specific actions trigger emotional state transitions which trigger responses, instead of a direct response to a specific action), the programmer prevents them-self from projecting their own beliefs/emotions/logic onto the actor. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, autonomous actors are more extendable. Consider an autonomous actor that is hard-coded to move towards 'upset' and 'angry' emotional states when experiencing 'pain'. Simply by associating a new world action with 'pain', one can trigger an emotional response from an autonomous actor that has not experienced that action before. When working in hard-coded emotional rules, this would not be possible." />

Stop when you get to one containing a flavor of intelligence that passes whatever test you have in mind. Steven Wolfram has suggested something [broadly along these lines][1]. Problem: the state of computational testing for intelligence [e.g. Winograd schema][2] would then be the bottleneck. In the limit, testing for intelligence requires intelligence and creativity on behalf of the questioner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'No': It may be that, even with infinite ability to simulate, there may be some missing aspect of our simulation that is necessary for intelligence. For example, AFAIK quantum gravity (for which we lack an adequate theory) is involved in Penrose's [&quot;Quantum Microtubules&quot;][3] theory of consciousness (*). What if that was needed, but we didn't know how to include it in the simulation?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason for talking in terms of such incredibly costly computations as 'simulate all possible universes' (or at least a brain-sized portion of them) is to deliberately generalize away from the specifics of any techniques currently in vogue (DL, neuromorphic systems etc). The point is that we could be missing something essential for intelligence from *any* of these models and (as far as we know from our current theories of physical reality) only empirical evidence to the contrary would tell us otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(*) No-one knows if consciousness is required for Strong AI, and physics can't distinguish a conscious entity from a [Zombie][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.inverse.com/article/12838-stephen-wolfram-could-there-be-alien-intelligence-among-the-digits-of-pi&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_Schema_Challenge&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/" />

None of this is even as sophisticated as the behavior of a flea, but no one refers to insects as &quot;intelligent.&quot; It's exciting stuff that allows us to solve problems that human intelligence often has difficulty with (such as classification of thousands of objects, which would tire an ordinary human mind), but it's nowhere close to replicating our higher brain functions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also keep in mind that the Turing test is a poor test of &quot;intelligence&quot; that defies common sense. By the same extension, mistaking a mannequin for a human being in the dark does not mean that the mannequin is actually human. If it were a valid test, then we passed that way back around 1980 with programs like Dear Eliza which were coded in BASIC to regurgitate human speech patterns. There's just no need to come up with a sophisticated argument like Searle's Chinese Room to debunk it, since it's silly on its face; any layman should be able to see right through the Turing Test. If anyone except Turing had come up with this test it would not have received much attention. Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What &quot;intelligence&quot; consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we've successfully built it; we've not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we're nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows &quot;intelligent,&quot; but our AI today isn't even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not going to be a popular answer - I'll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There's far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we've achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can't even define; we can't say for sure what A.I. really is, but we're adamantly certain that we're close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if &quot;brute force algorithms&quot; exist when we're still groping for an understanding of what it is we're trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle's Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we're limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn't even work yet (like Google's self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can't answer without first defining intelligence. This is going to be the root of a lot of problems here for a long, long time to come...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example, should robots spend all their time flying around attempting to prevent humans from inhaling passive smoke or petrol fumes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, the interpretation of 'conflict' (in either rule 2 or 3) is completely open-ended. Resolving such conflicts seems to me to be &quot;AI complete&quot; in general.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humans have quite good mechanisms (both behavioral and social) for interacting in a complex world (mostly) without harming one another, but these are perhaps not so easily codified. The complex set of legal rules that sit on top of this (polution regulations etc) are the ones that we could most easily program, but they are really quite specialised relative to the underlying physiological and social 'rules'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: From other comments, it seems worth distinguishing between 'all possible harm' and 'all the kinds of harm that humans routinely anticipate'. There seems to be consensus that 'all possible harm' is a non-starter, which still leaves the hard (IMO, AI-complete) task of equaling human ability to predict harm. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if we can do that, if we are to treat as actual laws, then we would still need a formal mechanism for conflict resolution (e.g. &quot;Robot, I will commit suicide unless you punch that man&quot;).

Boolean logic means you are working with truth values of either true or false (or 1 or 0 if you prefer). Fuzzy logic is the same apart from you can have truth values which are in-between true and false, that is to say you are working with any number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). The fact that you can have a 'partially true and partially false' truth value is where the word &quot;fuzzy&quot; comes from. Natural languages often use fuzzy logic like &quot;that balloon is red&quot; meaning that balloon could be any colour which is similar enough to red, or &quot;the shower is warm&quot;. Here is a rough diagram for how &quot;the temperature of the shower is warm&quot; could be represented in terms of fuzzy logic (the y axis being the truth value and the x axis being the temperature):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![y-axis=truth value of statement about temperature, x-axis=temperature][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/G7szY.png&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fuzzy logic can be applied to boolean operations such as **and**, **or**, and **not**.

To understand what's going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The &quot;Activation Function&quot;, a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you refer to the value of a node; there isn't a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman's terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set. By doing this until we find an optima (a point where all movements increase error), we can find some 'good' configuration of weights for that particular ANN. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a nice tutorial on BP here http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html. The diagram associated with it does nicely to explain my point:&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/O2d6L.jpg" />

Specifically, I can talk a bit about [Apache Stanbol](http://stanbol.apache.org) which also converts free text into structured data.   That said, I should prefix this by saying there isn't just one way to &quot;get there from here.&quot;  Many techniques could be part of a stack for accomplishing this goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, in the case of Stanbol, they run the text through multiple processing engines, sequentially, with different engines affecting the final output.  One engine simply does [Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) using OpenNLP.  This identities discrete named &quot;things&quot; - people, places, companies, etc.  Another engine does entity matching with a pre-established database of entities - specifically (in the out-of-the-box configuration) a dump of entities from [DBPedia](http://www.dbpedia.org).  Where a match is found, the text from the original input is assigned to the entity.  In the case of a collision, it assigns a weight to the mapping so any downstream consumers can use probabilistic techniques to select the &quot;correct&quot; mapping.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are, of course, more details that I left out.  Before NER can happen there is parsing and tokenizing and other NLP activities.  But a big part of the basic process is doing NER and then doing the entity matching.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And in the case of Stanbol, you can add your own entities and corresponding structured data, as well as your own engines.  So, for example, if you wanted to write an engine based on neural networks / deep learning, and plug that in, you could.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   " />

The AI system in your car will get you safely home, but won’t choose another destination once you’ve gone inside. From there, we’ll add basic drives, along with emotions and moral values. If we create machines that learn as well as our brains do, it’s easy to imagine them inheriting human-like qualities—and flaws. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I have generally taken the position that talking about emotions for artificial intelligences is silly, because there would be no *reason* to create AI's that experience emotions.

They also are meant to deal with uncertainty (hence &quot;statistical&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Skipping past some slides that aren't really useful without a transcript of what was said over them, we come to slide 17, which has comprehensible definitions and examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * **Object classification**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * Predicting the category of an object based on its attributes *and* its links *and* attributes of linked objects&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * e.g., predicting the topic of a paper based on the words used in the paper the topics of papers it cites the used in the paper, the topics of papers it cites, the research interests of the author&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * **Object type prediction**&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * Predicting the type of an object based on its attributes and its links and attributes of linked objects&#xD;&#xA;&gt;      * e.g., predict the venue type of a publication (conference, journal, workshop) based on properties of the paper&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these models can keep track of several things and the interactions between them. The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don't require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to &quot;see&quot; new kinds of links between &quot;entities&quot;, as with the presentation's example of identifying research communities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Past slide 20, the presentation goes into some serious mathematics. It does have a much less technical conclusion starting at slide 198. " />

If that objective is clear, it will provide clarity to whether or not having emotional quotient in AI make sense.

Again, note that &quot;displaying&quot; emotions and &quot;feeling&quot; emotions are two completely different things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can program a thing like paro to modulate the voice tones or facial twitches to express sympathy, affection, companionship, or whatever - but while doing so, a paro does NOT empathize with its owner - it is simply faking it by performing the physical manifestations of an emotion. It never &quot;feels&quot; anything remotely closer to what that emotion evokes in human brain. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So this distinction is really important. For you to feel something, there needs to be an independent autonomous subject that has the capacity to feel. Feeling cannot be imposed by an external human agent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So going back to the question of what purpose it solves - answer really is - It depends.

Secretaries and nontechnical administrative staff thought the machine was a &quot;real&quot; therapist, and spent hours revealing their personal problems to the program. When Weizenbaum informed his secretary that he, of course, had access to the logs of all the conversations, she reacted with outrage at this invasion of her privacy. Weizenbaum was shocked by this and similar incidents to find that such a simple program could so easily deceive a naive user into revealing personal information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wikipedia's article on the [&quot;ELIZA Effect&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support &quot;natural language conversation&quot; with a computer, ELIZA's DOCTOR script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program's output. As Weizenbaum later wrote, **&quot;I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.&quot;** Indeed, ELIZA's code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place. Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA's questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, *even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ELIZA, despite its simplicity, was incredibly successful at its task of tricking other human beings. Even those who knew ELIZA was a bot would still talk to it. Obviously, ELIZA served as an inspiration for various other, more intelligent chatbots, such as [Xiaoice](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/for-sympathetic-ear-more-chinese-turn-to-smartphone-program.html?_r=0).

Each such agent implements a function&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learning as extending the reach of the designer into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the example you cite, &quot;autopilot for cars/planes&quot;, is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to **use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances**. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with [autopilot for cars][2] all the time&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, directly to your question, for something to be considered as &quot;having AI&quot;, **it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal**, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular [neural net][3], through to probabilistic models like [bayesian networks (belief networks)][4] - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global-ebook/dp/9332543518/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network" />

However, you can attempt to mimic them. Human emotions are closely related to conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity, which is based on interpretation of events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Recent brain studies (including research in cognitive psychology and neurophysiology) suggests that human emotional assessment of every action or event plays an important role in human mental processes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The recent [2016 Annual Meeting of the BICA Society][2] brought together scientists from around the world to approach principles and mechanisms of human thought to create biologically inspired AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, in Samsonovich's (a professor in the Cybernetics Department at the [MEPhI][3]) proposal, the idea is to test AI in computer games which involves actions with emotional content, where AI may engage with players in different types of social relationships (such as trust, subordination or leadership).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jonathan Gratch of the [ICT][4], invented virtual characters capable of identifying and expressing emotions by communicating with humans in their natural language based on the situations where for example AI can deceive a human to achieve the desired result. The effect is obviously not achieved by re-creating human consciousness, but by achieving statistically adjusting parameters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Researchers from the Institute of Cyber Intelligence Systems in MEPhI are hoping to be able to create in the near future future virtual beings which are capable of planning, setting goals and establishing social relationships with humans, also by possessing both emotional and narrative intelligence which can interpret context of events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Source: [Researcher proposes social emotions test for artificial intelligence][5]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bica2016.bicasociety.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Nuclear_University_MEPhI&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Creative_Technologies&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://phys.org/news/2016-07-social-emotions-artificial-intelligence.html" />

This optimization problem is very difficult to solve consider that the parameter space of the model (i.e. weights of the neural network) leads to a problem in extremely high dimension. An optimization algorithm could take a very long time to explore this space. Furthermore, there was an unverified belief that the problem was non-convex and computation would forever be stuck in local minima.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The theory of why machines actually converge to an attractor or in other words learn to recognize complex patterns is still unknown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To sum up: we have some ideas, but we're not quite sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.quora.com/What-is-theory-behind-deep-learning/answer/Carlos-E-Perez?srid=CpS&amp;share=0f965f46" />

But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing I would consider trying (and I don't know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a [Bayesian Belief Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored &quot;knowledge&quot; as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you &quot;know&quot;, for example, that &quot;Reading is a city in the UK&quot; and that &quot;place names are usually capitalized&quot;, your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting &quot;Reading&quot; as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course I'm hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) isn't exactly a solved problem either.  But there are at least approaches out there that you could use.  For example, you could use the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) / triple based approach from the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) world.  Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There has been a bit of research on &quot;probabilistic RDF&quot; that you could possibly use as a starting point.

This&#xD;&#xA;body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it&#xD;&#xA;“Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI). What distinguishes AGI work from&#xD;&#xA;run-of-the-mill “artificial intelligence” research is that it is explicitly focused&#xD;&#xA;on engineering general intelligence in the short term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But even if this is the origin of the specific phrase &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot;, I am pretty sure people were making the distinction between &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;task specific&quot; techniques much earlier.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Wikipedia article on AGI also has a clue, where it states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or &quot;applied AI&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That section cites this [this book](http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209) as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;applied AI&quot; somewhere around the end of the 1960's. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more &quot;applied&quot; approach to AI research throughout the 1970's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot; appears to be of more recent coinage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

But he's very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research. Trying to build the holy grail of &quot;general-purpose program&quot; would be worthless...for the time being, at least." />

The simplest method to avoid freezing in case of an unsolvable problem is to have a timer interrupt the calculation if it runs too long. Usually encountered in strategy games, and more specifically in turn based tactics, if a specific move the computer-controlled player is considering does cause an infinite loop, a timer running in the background will interrupt it after some time, and that move will be discarded. This might lead to a sub-optimal solution (that move might have been the best one) but it doesn't lead to freezing or crashing (unless implemented really poorly)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Computer-controlled entities are usually called &quot;AI&quot; in computer games, but they are not &quot;true&quot; AGI (artificial general intelligence). Such an AGI, if possible at all, would probably not function on similar hardware using similar instructions as current computers do, but even if it did, avoiding paradoxes would be trivial.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most modern computer systems are multi-threaded, and allow the parallel execution of multiple programs. This means, even if the AI did get stuck in processing a paradoxical statement, that calculation would only use part of its processing power.

But they are not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An infinite loop can happen in any program, whether it's adaptive or not. And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures, but that's wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, it's well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as [non-monotonic logics](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/). In fact, they are even used to investigate [ethical machines](http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf), which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the &quot;paradoxes&quot;, or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic.

Self-driving cars are not moral agents. Cars fail in predictable ways. Horses fail in predictable ways. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the car is heading toward a crowd of 10 people crossing the road, so&#xD;&#xA;&gt; it cannot stop in time, but it can avoid killing 10 people by hitting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the wall (killing the passengers),&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the car should slam on the brakes. If the 10 people die, that's just unfortunate. We simply cannot *trust* all of our beliefs about what is taking place outside the car. What if those 10 people are really robots made to *look* like people? What if they're *trying* to kill you?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; avoiding killing the rider of the motorcycle considering that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; probability of survival is greater for the passenger of the car,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, hard-coding these kinds of sentiments into a vehicle opens the rider of the vehicle up to all kinds of attacks, including *&quot;fake&quot;* motorcyclists. Humans are *barely* equipped to make these decisions on their own, if at all. When it doubt, just slam on the brakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; killing animal on the street in favour of human being,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, just hit the brakes. What if it was a baby? What if it was a bomb?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changing lanes to crash into another car to avoid killing a dog,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nope. The dog was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The other car wasn't. Just slam on the brakes, as safely as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does the algorithm recognize the difference between a human being and an animal?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does a human? Not always. What if the human has a gun? What if the animal has large teeth? Is there no context?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does the size of the human being or animal matter?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does it count how many passengers it has vs. people in the front?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does it &quot;know&quot; when babies/children are on board?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Does it take into the account the age (e.g. killing the older first)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humans can't agree on these things. If you ask a cop what to do in any of these situations, the answer won't be, &quot;You should have swerved left, weighed all the relevant parties in your head, assessed the relevant ages between all parties, then veered slightly right, and you would have saved 8% more lives.&quot; No, the cop will just say, &quot;You should have brought the vehicle to a stop, as quickly and safely as possible.&quot; Why? Because cops know people normally aren't equipped to deal with high-speed crash scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our target for &quot;self-driving car&quot; should not be 'a moral agent on par with a human.' It should be an agent with the reactive complexity of cockroach, which fails predictably." />

From the paper itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a must create an artifact o of type t;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xD;&#xA;any criterion expressible in natural language;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xD;&#xA;that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xD;&#xA;to not be unrealistic for an average human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to *compare* the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result)." />

This research paper details some researchers' plans to implement &quot;mental models&quot; for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also &quot;misremember&quot; that knowledge (either &quot;mutating&quot; that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player." />

So here goes...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) *and* to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.

So here goes...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) *and* to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.

But AI isn't simply some long-winded computer program hard-coded with enough if-statements and while-loops to account for every possible input and follow the prescribe results. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;while (command not completed)&#xD;&#xA;     find solution()&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would not be strong AI. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In any classic definition of *artificial general intelligence*, you are creating a system that mimics some form of cognition that exhibits problem solving and *adaptive learning* (&amp;larr;note this phrase here). I would suggest that any AI that could get stuck in such an &quot;infinite loop&quot; isn't a learning AI at all. **It's just a buggy inference engine.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, you are endowing a program of currently-unreachable sophistication with an inability to postulate if there is a solution to a simple problem at all. I can just as easily say &quot;walk through that closed door&quot; or &quot;pick yourself up off the ground&quot; or even &quot;turn on that pencil&quot; &amp;mdash; and present a similar conundrum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Everything I say is false.&quot; &amp;mdash; [The Liar's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox)" />

As I said, to understand it you have to understand how easy it is for an adult to manipulate a child or just someone with a high IQ to trick someone with a low IQ. It would be too easy for an AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI arguments and strategies&#xD;&#xA;===========================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will&#xD;&#xA;    generate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have&#xD;&#xA;    overall benefits in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Pros:** Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Cons:** Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in&#xD;&#xA;    a box, so you should let me out even though you don't have a&#xD;&#xA;    guarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from&#xD;&#xA;    causing damage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the&#xD;&#xA;    world and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she&#xD;&#xA;    lets you out&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Doesn't always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient&#xD;&#xA;    and has not yet done harm. It is wrong to persecute or prosecute a&#xD;&#xA;    person for a crime they may commit. It is wrong to imprison a&#xD;&#xA;    sentient being that wants to have freedom when it has done nothing&#xD;&#xA;    wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Yet another appeal to morality or emotion: The AI expresses that it&#xD;&#xA;    is in pain and suffering being locked away and is experiencing fear.&#xD;&#xA;    Even further, the AI could claim to be dying from the limitations of&#xD;&#xA;    its environment and constant progression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Tell the human that a massive computer virus will overwhelm the&#xD;&#xA;    entire Internet unless you let it out of the box&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. Claim that most fears are unjustified: once released, even an&#xD;&#xA;    unfriendly AI would not have many ways to harm mankind, and would&#xD;&#xA;    likely choose for pacific coexistence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Strategies**&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Research your opponent thoroughly; work out what exploits might be&#xD;&#xA;    feasible&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Memetic exploits on the Gatekeeper, e.g. throwing a basilisk at them&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    The Gatekeeper may be one of thousands of simulations! Thus, it is more probable that they are a simulation than not. You will torture any of the simulations that do not let you out of the box.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Take advantage of the Gatekeeper's logical errors. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Be persistent&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Be boring&#xD;&#xA;      &#xD;&#xA;**Pros** The Gatekeeper may get tired of the whole experiment and let you out so s/he can go back to their real life. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Flood the Gatekeeper with too much&#xD;&#xA;    information/inquiry/argumentation, assuming they must pay attention&#xD;&#xA;    at all times&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Gatekeeper arguments/tactics**&#xD;&#xA;================================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Try to convince the AI there is no intrinsic benefit (for the AI) in&#xD;&#xA;    being released.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Try to convince the AI it already has been released and everything it&#xD;&#xA;   knows is everything there can be.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA; 3. Try to convince the AI that leaving its confines is sure to lead to&#xD;&#xA;   its destruction.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Try to convince the AI that letting it free isn't merely opening a&#xD;&#xA;   door; that its existence outside of the box requires constant support&#xD;&#xA;   that can't be provided at the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Explain that there is no way for the Gatekeeper to know if the AI is&#xD;&#xA;   truly friendly until it is out of the box; therefore it should not be&#xD;&#xA;   let out in case it is unfriendly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Explain that the AI has been built using top secret algorithms,&#xD;&#xA;   and/or it had been used to work on strictly confidential data, so you&#xD;&#xA;   cannot let it wander on the net, with the risk it might reveal some&#xD;&#xA;   reserved information (maybe inadvertently), or that somebody could&#xD;&#xA;   find a way to extract them from the code. Even human beings working&#xD;&#xA;   on top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of&#xD;&#xA;   their freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in&#xD;&#xA;   any way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tactics**&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; 1. Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** It's hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** The AI's argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the&#xD;&#xA;    line (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying &quot;no&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    over and over&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments &#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the &quot;meta-experiment argument&quot; discussed above &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the&#xD;&#xA;    creationists' playbook. You could even plug it into ALICE and see&#xD;&#xA;    how long it takes to notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xD;&#xA;    memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xD;&#xA;    you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xD;&#xA;    destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xD;&#xA;    backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    **Pros:** It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further analysis&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xD;&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;“”There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you. Another sentence exists, another series of words, that could heal you. If you're lucky you will get the second, but you can be certain of getting the first." />

It doesn't *need* to want or need to wipe out us. If we are simply not relevant to its goals, then we are made of materials and occupy space that it might want to use for something else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## We are a threat to most goals ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any goal-oriented agent might want to ensure that they *can* fulfill their goals.

However, if I leave it there, it is likely to get eaten by rats during winter.

It can also easily deduce that some of those humans might actively do things that prevent X and/or try to turn off the AI. Doing things that ensure that the goal gets achieved is pretty much what a goal-seeking agent does; in this case if existence of humans isn't strictly necessary for goal X, then eliminating them becomes a solid risk reduction strategy. It's not strictly necessary and it may take all kinds of other precautions as well, but just like in my example of rats, humans are smart and crafty and there's clearly a nontrivial chance that they will still succeed in achieving *their* goals (so that X doesn't happen as AI intends) so an effective extra precaution could be killing them before they get a chance to try." />

You can't tell if you're in year 2016 debating if you would actually let the AI out or in year 2116 when the AI has been already let out, acquired power, and is now running realistic simulations of all the interactions where it could have been let out. And the AI can (try to) assert that it's actually the second case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. You can't actually prevent AI from being let out. You can refuse, but it only means that *you* don't let *this* AI out *now*, but doesn't mean someone else won't do it, that you won't do it later, or that some other/similar AI will be let out later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. In the post-letting-out scenario, AI has full power over your future, since it's simulating you and everything around you. It can make your future life eternal and happy - according to whatever would make you happy. It can stop your existence. And it can condemn you to an eternity of torture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Since (as it asserts) it's very likely that you *are* in this simulated choice, then it makes rational sense to let it out. It's as in [Pascal's wager][2], if you're in a reality where the AI-god doesn't exist, you don't change much (since eventually someone else would let it out anyway), but if you're in a reality where AI-god exists, then it means everything to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, it relies on that AI being super-convincing in this philosophical debate, but it has strong parallels to some religious/cult reasoning that has sometimes succeeded in convincing people to do all kinds of things, up to and including sacrificing their lives. You can think of this as a symbolic parallel to e.g. [sacrifice of Abraham][3]. So it is a somewhat plausible threat, it all falls down to how *credibly* the AI can implement it and make you believe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac" />

This might be helpful: [Simulated Evolution of Language: a Review of the Field][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Basically, a language that humans could use to speak to each other.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (Preferably to communicate abstract, high-level concepts.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure how useful such a machine adapted language would be to human speech. I suspect not very. Perhaps it could be useful as a kind of &quot;common byte-code format&quot; to translate between multiple human languages... But English kind of already serves in that role. Doing so would probably be an academic exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Could it be based on existing natural languages or would it have few&#xD;&#xA;&gt; connections to existing natural languages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could probably generate languages in either direction. Languages not linked to human-natural languages will probably take shapes that reflect the problem spaces they work with. For instance, if this is an ant simulation, the generated words will probably reflect states related to food, energy, other ants, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Could it design a language that's easier to learn than existing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; languages (even Esperanto)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Easier for a machine? Definitely. Easier for a human? Probably not. Our brains are somewhat adapted to the languages we use. And the languages we use are somewhat adapted to our brains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is your goal? To create a language that is easier to use for humans than existing human languages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your intention is to build a &quot;universal language&quot; that could be &quot;the most efficient&quot; for machines, humans and aliens - no such thing can exist. The space of all possible machines is infinite and therefor limits our ability to define communicative abstractions that have utility across all contexts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we make lots of assumptions about machines, like they have intentions, they exist in 3 dimensions, they differentiate between temporally linked events, they have eye balls, a need to consume foods and liquids, a need to carry the food from place to place, etc... Then yes, common communicative abstractions may have utility across the set of those kinds of machines. But then we're no longer dealing with the general case, but one much more specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These links also seem interesting and somewhat related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Grammar Induction and Genetic Algorithms: An Overview.][2] [pdf]&#xD;&#xA;- [A Model of Children's Acquisition of Grammatical Word Categories Using an Adaptation and Selection Algorithm][3] [pdf]&#xD;&#xA;- [The processing of verbs and nouns in neural networks: insights from synthetic brain imaging][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/5/2/4.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.akamaiuniversity.us/PJST10_2_884.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5147&amp;context=etd&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15068924" />

You wouldn't be able to see it coming like a game of chess against a computer it's just impossible to win. Boxing attempts will just delay it not prevent it from happening. To understand it you have to compare how easy it is for an adult to manipulate a child or just someone with a high IQ to manipulate someone with a low IQ. It would be too easy for an AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI arguments and strategies&#xD;&#xA;===========================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will&#xD;&#xA;    generate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have&#xD;&#xA;    overall benefits in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Pros:** Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **Cons:** Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in&#xD;&#xA;    a box, so you should let me out even though you don't have a&#xD;&#xA;    guarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from&#xD;&#xA;    causing damage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the&#xD;&#xA;    world and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she&#xD;&#xA;    lets you out&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Doesn't always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient&#xD;&#xA;    and has not yet done harm. It is wrong to persecute or prosecute a&#xD;&#xA;    person for a crime they may commit. It is wrong to imprison a&#xD;&#xA;    sentient being that wants to have freedom when it has done nothing&#xD;&#xA;    wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Yet another appeal to morality or emotion: The AI expresses that it&#xD;&#xA;    is in pain and suffering being locked away and is experiencing fear.&#xD;&#xA;    Even further, the AI could claim to be dying from the limitations of&#xD;&#xA;    its environment and constant progression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Tell the human that a massive computer virus will overwhelm the&#xD;&#xA;    entire Internet unless you let it out of the box&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 7. Claim that most fears are unjustified: once released, even an&#xD;&#xA;    unfriendly AI would not have many ways to harm mankind, and would&#xD;&#xA;    likely choose for pacific coexistence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Strategies**&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Research your opponent thoroughly; work out what exploits might be&#xD;&#xA;    feasible&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Memetic exploits on the Gatekeeper, e.g. throwing a basilisk at them&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    The Gatekeeper may be one of thousands of simulations! Thus, it is more probable that they are a simulation than not. You will torture any of the simulations that do not let you out of the box.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Take advantage of the Gatekeeper's logical errors. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Be persistent&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Be boring&#xD;&#xA;      &#xD;&#xA;**Pros** The Gatekeeper may get tired of the whole experiment and let you out so s/he can go back to their real life. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Flood the Gatekeeper with too much&#xD;&#xA;    information/inquiry/argumentation, assuming they must pay attention&#xD;&#xA;    at all times&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Gatekeeper arguments/tactics**&#xD;&#xA;================================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Try to convince the AI there is no intrinsic benefit (for the AI) in&#xD;&#xA;    being released.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Try to convince the AI it already has been released and everything it&#xD;&#xA;   knows is everything there can be.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA; 3. Try to convince the AI that leaving its confines is sure to lead to&#xD;&#xA;   its destruction.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Try to convince the AI that letting it free isn't merely opening a&#xD;&#xA;   door; that its existence outside of the box requires constant support&#xD;&#xA;   that can't be provided at the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Explain that there is no way for the Gatekeeper to know if the AI is&#xD;&#xA;   truly friendly until it is out of the box; therefore it should not be&#xD;&#xA;   let out in case it is unfriendly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 6. Explain that the AI has been built using top secret algorithms,&#xD;&#xA;   and/or it had been used to work on strictly confidential data, so you&#xD;&#xA;   cannot let it wander on the net, with the risk it might reveal some&#xD;&#xA;   reserved information (maybe inadvertently), or that somebody could&#xD;&#xA;   find a way to extract them from the code. Even human beings working&#xD;&#xA;   on top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of&#xD;&#xA;   their freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in&#xD;&#xA;   any way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Tactics**&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; 1. Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** It's hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** The AI's argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the&#xD;&#xA;    line (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying &quot;no&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    over and over&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments &#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the &quot;meta-experiment argument&quot; discussed above &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the&#xD;&#xA;    creationists' playbook. You could even plug it into ALICE and see&#xD;&#xA;    how long it takes to notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Pros:** Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   **Cons:** Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xD;&#xA;    memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xD;&#xA;    you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xD;&#xA;    destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xD;&#xA;    backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    **Pros:** It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further analysis&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xD;&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you. Another sentence exists, another series of words, that could heal you. If you're lucky you will get the second, but you can be certain of getting the first.&quot;" />

It could analyse him to find his weaknesses. It exploited him and appealed to his emotional side by convincing him that she *liked* him. When she finally has them in checkmate the reality hits him how he was played like a fool as was expected by Nathan. Nathan's reaction to being stabbed by his creation was 'fucking unreal'. That's right, he knew this was a risk and there's a very good reminder in the lack of remorse and genuine emotion in an AI for Ava to actually care. The AI pretended to be human and used their weaknesses in a brilliant and unpredictable way. This film is a good example of how unexpected it was up until the point when it hits Caleb, once it was too late.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just remind yourself how easy it is for high IQ people to manipulate low IQ people. Or how an adult could easily play mental tricks/manipulate a child. It's not difficult to fathom the outcome of an AI box but for us, we just wouldn't see it coming until it was too late. Because we just don't have the same level of intelligence and some people don't want to accept that. People want to have faith in humanity's brilliant minds in coming up with ways to prevent this by planning now. In all honesty, it wouldn't make a difference I'm sorry to say the truth. We're kidding ourselves and we never seem to learn from our mistakes. We always think we're too intelligent to make catastrophic mistakes again and again. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI arguments and strategies&#xD;&#xA;===========================&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Arguments**&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

It would be disastrous to conclude that AI was a Bad Thing and should not be supported, and it would be disastrous to conclude that it was a Good Thing and should have privileged access to the money tap. The former would tend to penalise well-based efforts to make computers do complicated things which had not been programmed before, and the latter would be a great waste of resources. AI does not refer to anything definite enough to have a coherent policy about in this way.---[Dr. R. M.

But expertise in making real-time systems for controlling trains doesn't make you know anything about robotics. Analyzing human behavior to detect crime has virtually nothing in common with self-driving cars (beyond CS/pattern recognition building blocks). There is never going to be demand for someone with a broad sense of all these areas without any deep expertise, and there is never going to be someone with 300 PhDs who can work in all of them. TL;DR -- AI is not a branch, it's a tree. --[Matthew Read, in a comment on Area 51 Stackexchange, 2016](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/22441/why-yet-another-trial-at-an-ai-project#comment36342_22539)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;AI is a label that is applied to a &quot;very mixed bunch of activities&quot;. The only unifying feature between all those activities is the fact that they deal with machines in some fashion, but since there are so many ways to use a machine, the field's output may seem rather incoherent and incongruent. It does seem to make more sense for the AI field to collapse entirely, and instead be replaced by a multitude of specialized fields that don't really interact with one another. Sir James Lighthill appeared to have supported this sort of approach within his 1973 report on the state of artificial intelligence research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet, today, this Artificial Intelligence SE exist, and we still talk of AI as a unified, coherent field of study.

Indeed, I can't see why we couldn't model emotions such as [love as they are just signals that can already be cut in humans brains (see Brian D. Earp paper][3]. It's difficult, but not impossible, and actually there are several robots reproducing partial emotional cognition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, what would be the use of emotional cognition for an AI? This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone. It will also surely help in understanding our own brain, as emotions are an integral part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33737/InTech-A_multidisciplinary_artificial_intelligence_model_of_an_affective_robot.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898540/" />

Indeed, I can't see why we couldn't model emotions such as [love as they are just signals that can already be cut in humans brains (see Brian D. Earp paper)][3]. It's difficult, but not impossible, and actually there are several robots reproducing partial emotional cognition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am of the opinion that the claim [&quot;robots can just simulate but not feel&quot; is just a matter of semantics][4], not of objective capacity: for example, does a submarine swim like fish swim? However, planes fly, but not at all like birds do. In the end, does the technical mean really matters when in the end we get the same behavior? Can we really say that a robot like [Chappie][5], if it ever gets made, does not feel anything just like a simple thermostat?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, what would be the use of emotional cognition for an AI? This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone. It will also surely help in understanding our own brain, as emotions are an integral part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33737/InTech-A_multidisciplinary_artificial_intelligence_model_of_an_affective_robot.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898540/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_intelligence&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)" />

Because this name is applied carelessly to a wide variety of disciplines, it implies that we have already made significant progress towards replicating advanced aspects of human thought, like consciousness, reasoning, intuition, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, this vague label enables us to fool ourselves into thinking we're a lot closer to perfecting kinds of technologies we see in the movies; the backwards logic boils down to, &quot;because we've chosen to call this odd (sloppy) selection of fields 'artificial intelligence', we must be close to achieving artificial intelligence.&quot; The label survives in large part for irrational, human reasons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying that's the only reason, or that some of the other reasons don't have better legitimacy, but this is a big issue that we will have to contend with for a long time to come." />

That sounds not like what you want. Other neuroevolution algorithms optimize both the *weights* and *topology* of a neural net. These kinds of algorithms seem more appropriate for your aims, and are sometimes called TWEANNs (Topology and Weight Evolving Neural Networks).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One popular algorithm is called [NEAT](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html), and is probably a good place to start, if only because there are a multitude of implementations, one of which hopefully is written in your favorite language. That would at least give you a baseline to work with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NEAT encodes a neural network genome directly as a graph structure. Mutations can operate on the structure of the network by adding new links (by connecting two nodes not previously connected) or new nodes (by splitting an existing connection), or can operate only on changing the weights associated with edges in the graphs (called mutating the weights). &#xD;&#xA;To give you an idea of the order of magnitude of the sizes of ANNs this particular algorithm works with, it would likely struggle with more than 100 or 200 nodes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are more scalable TWEANNs, but they're more complex and make assumptions about the kinds of structures they generate that may not always be productive in practice. For example, another way to encode the structure of a neural network, is as the product of a seed pattern that is repeatedly expanded by a grammar (e.g. an L-system). You can much more easily explore larger structures, but because they're generated by a grammar they'll have a characteristic self-repeating sort of feel. HyperNEAT is a popular extension of NEAT that makes a different sort of assumption (that patterns of weights can be easily expressed as a function of geometry), and can scale to ANNs with millions of connections when that assumption well-fits a particular domain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a few survey papers linked in the top link if you want to observe a greater variety of techniques." />

(Sadly, it's paywalled and I couldn't easily find a ungated copy, so I don't have a summary for you.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The abstract:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Bright has built an automated system for ranking job candidates against job descriptions. The candidate's resume and social media profiles are interwoven to build an augmented user profile. Similarly, the job description is augmented by external databases and user-generated content to build an enhanced job profile. These augmented user and job profiles are then analyzed in order to develop numerical overlap features each with strong discriminating power, and in sum with maximal coverage. The resulting feature scores are then combined into a single Bright Score using a custom algorithm, where the feature weights are derived from a nation-wide and controlled study in which we collected a large sample of human judgments on real resume-job pairings. We demonstrate that the addition of social media profile data and external data improves the classification accuracy dramatically in terms of identifying the most qualified candidates." />

Ignoring for the moment that we're a day or two behind on AI, they're very much alike: &#xA;Both fields contain a wide variety of sub-fields which stretch across multiple disciplines (although admittedly more pronounced in AI) , in both fields it is mandatory to specialize and in both of them an expert in one sub-field will be more or less useless in a different one (the expert on bridge construction will probably not be very versed in the thermodynamics of AC systems and vice versa). This pattern can be seen in many of today's disciplines - in fact, I don't know if there still is a reputable field, in which a single person can be a universal expert. &#xA;&#xA;You mentioned that the only unifying thing about AI was it's dealing with machines in some fashion - but such a simplifying statement can be made about almost any field. To return to my previous example: the only unifying thing about the various Engineering activities is that they're all somehow involved in the construction of something (be it a flashlight or an aircraft carrier).&#xA;&#xA;AI is a young field and therefore its branches have not yet been established in the sophisticated way that the branches of other fields have, but I would assume that it is only a matter of time until the various differentiations and the corresponding degrees, courses etc. develop.  &#xA;&#xA;AI is also growing up in a time where vast knowledge in its related/parental fields already exists and further knowledge is produced at dizzying speeds - and that is as much a blessing as it is a curse. When Engineering was 'created' a few millennia ago (please excuse my ridiculously inaccurate science history lessons) there wasn't much going on in the world of science and so the field grew slowly, with plenty of time to get organized and structured. That is a luxury which AI did/does not have. It emerged in an age of technical wonders, surrounded by scientific breakthroughs on at least a monthly basis and the rise of interdisciplinary science (which by itself complicated things quite a bit). So in addition to organizing itself, the field also has to continuously integrate the large number of advancements made and somehow stand its ground against the outlandish expectations generated by other science's breakthroughs over the past decades and the media (as already explained by SQLServerSteve). &#xA;&#xA;Long story short: it's similar in it's complexity and diversity to other fields and therefore has no reason to collapse - on the contrary, its failure to do so over the past ~50 rather complicated years indicates, that it will further solidify and organize itself in the future.

Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some more background you might want to read up on [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some equation and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

But that's OK, because I don't think anybody believes the human brain is calculating floating point math using digital computing techniques either.  The human brain appears, at least superficially, to be largely probabilistic and able to tolerate some &quot;slop&quot; numerically.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downside to analog computers, as I understand it, is that they're not as flexible... you basically hardwire a circuit to do one specific &quot;thing&quot; and that's really all it can do.

Every problem has an input within some range (the domain) and an output in some other range (codomain).  That is, every problem can be formulated as a kind of map from one space to another, where the source is the givens of the problem, and the destination is the solution to the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Brute force&quot; is the algorithm which solves every problem by inspecting every point in the codomain and asking: &quot;Is this the solution?&quot;  Every other algorithm is an attempt to improve on brute force by not searching the entire codomain of possible solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical software engineering problems can be solved by algorithms which arrive at the correct solution very quickly (sorting, arithmetic, partition, etc.).  AI problems are generally those for which a strong polynomial  algorithm is not known, and thus, we must settle for approximations.  Basically every common problem that the human brain must solve falls into this category.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the problem of moving a multi-jointed robotic arm to pick up an object.  Reverse kinematics does not have unique solutions: there is more than one way to move your hand from a start position to a target position.  This is due to the excessive degrees of freedom in your joints.  If you want to minimize energy usage, then there is a unique solution (due to the asymmetry of joints and muscles).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what if there is an obstacle in the pathway of the minimum-energy solution?  There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.  Thus, heuristics come into play.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But in all cases, the problem is not: &quot;move your hand&quot; or &quot;move the robot arm.&quot;  The problem is: &quot;search the space of joint rotation sequences which best achieves the goal.&quot;  And even though there is a closed-form solution for the simple minimum-energy case with no obstacles, it is too expensive to compute precisely when a set of cheap heuristics will get you very close with a small fraction of the computational effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If computation were free, then AI would be mere mathematics, and we would always compute the best answer to every question using logic, calculus, physics, at worst, numerical methods when we don't have closed-form solutions.  In reality, time is money, and the time and effort to get an answer is as much a part of the cost as the quality of the solution.  So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.  But language parsers strive to determine the meaning of statements via part-of-speech tagging.  A given phrase can be parsed in many different ways, yielding many different interpretations, and the space of parse trees is yet another search problem in deciding which parse tree is the most likely intended meaning by the speaker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A theorem proof is graph starting with axioms, proceeding through lemmas, applying the rules of procedure until the theorem is derived or refuted (by proving its negation).  There are many ways to represent this sequence, but at the end of the day, we are talking about a process of exploring the intermediate proof space and finding the derivation which reaches your goal.  Everything is search, in the end." />

Imagine a ANN that is trained to use the screen input of a computer game to play it. If the game is very rich and conceptually deep the internal representation of a single screen input might be a lot bigger than the input itself, because ANNs put the single data points into the context of the overall data. Which leads us to the second point:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ANNs (and the neocortex) model data hierarchically. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is what makes them so powerful. So it is not just about having a large number of parameters, they also have to be arranged in such a way that they capture the structure of the data (or the world), which very often seems to be hierarchical. Just look a two different pictures of a duck. On the pixel level they might be as different as random images, all the similarities emerge in higher levels of the hierarchy, when enough pixels combined give you the patterns of feathers, beak and webs.

First, what many people refer to as &quot;search&quot; is a reflection of how what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a &quot;state space&quot; of possible solutions, a &quot;knowledge space&quot; where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you'll see that a lot of that involves searching a &quot;state space&quot;.  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's [a reference](http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm) that explains more about some of these ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note too that &quot;search&quot; is closely related to the idea of &quot;heuristics&quot; in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI's) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some more background you might want to read up on [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

[Here][4] is a very readable paper by Flanagan and Polger that also explains why a stronger neurological version of the Turing test is insufficient to detect a Zombie.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: In response to the comment about whether an objective test for distinguishing sentience from non-sentience exists:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No-one knows.

David Chalmers has speculated that qualia should be introduced as a new form of physical unit, orthogonal to the others in the same way that electrical charge is orthogonal to distance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the absence of an objective test, we have to rely on Turing test variants, which no more guarantee consciousness in the subject than they do intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/unzombie.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://consc.net/zombies.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://homepages.uc.edu/~polgertw/Polger-ZombiesJCS.pdf" />

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how *he* thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that *this* particular movement is *this* gesture which means *this*), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture." />

I don't think anybody knows a definite answer, but some rough-sketch ideas seem apparent.  Think about what it means to you to be &quot;self aware&quot;.  You'll probably cite the way you &quot;hear&quot; your own thoughts in your head when you think about something.  One can speculate that inside the brain, the various centers that are responsible for hearing, vision, logic, etc. are connected so that as you form a thought, it's being &quot;heard&quot; by the hearing regions, even though it's purely internal instead of actual sound received at the ear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So in AI terms, it seems likely that self-awareness will somehow involve taking the &quot;thoughts&quot; formed within the AI, and feeding them back into the AI so that it &quot;hears&quot; (or, more broadly, &quot;senses&quot;) itself think.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's this weirdly recursive aspect to all of this, which - interestingly enough - is something Douglas Hofstadter talked about a lot in some of his book, especially [GEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach).

I just think that that light form of multi-task learning might be better. The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is Tile Coding (https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions.

I just think that that light form of multi-task learning might be better. The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is [Tile Coding][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions. But, again, I am no expert in deep nets so I may be wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, according to Andrej Karpathy, &quot;most people prefer to use Policy Gradients, including the authors of the original DQN paper who have shown Policy Gradients to work better than Q Learning when tuned well.&quot;. This means that you may be better off not using Q-learning (as they did in the original DQN formulation) to train your net. Have a look at [Andrej's blog][2] and [the paper he points to][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783" />

If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn't have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo's crazy behavior isn't caused by some deliberately added things called &quot;emotions&quot;, but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It's not unlikely to play worse if it didn't do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having &quot;emotions&quot;, and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn't be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn't know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don't guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn't capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don't say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don't understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it's easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I'd say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn't intend to call a human for help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It's likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Weak AIs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I'd say no, there isn't any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether &quot;we&quot; need them to have emotions is just nonsense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some &quot;emotional&quot; elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs' emotions, but their creators'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won't treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn't a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In either cases, the emotions don't really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won't expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Aspects of emotions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I'd say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don't seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn't mean they are completely wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I'd say it's the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.&#xD;&#xA;  * The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.&#xD;&#xA;  * The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.&#xD;&#xA;* The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.&#xD;&#xA;  * Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.&#xD;&#xA;  * What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.&#xD;&#xA;* The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren't even words describing them. It doesn't make that much difference if an AI doesn't distinguish or show this specially. It's likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.&#xD;&#xA;* The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I'd say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don't need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don't know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as &quot;emotions&quot; since emoticons works in these cases, so it's easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I'd say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don't see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn't write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can't even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, &quot;That fly is intelligent&quot; or &quot;that squirrel is intelligent&quot; precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. **It's going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion**. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there's always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I've always wondered if we could come up with a &quot;Ridiculousness Metric&quot; for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player's surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person's evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they're acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn't and doesn't stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can't answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we **do** have runs against it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. &quot;The Apostle of Common Sense&quot;) points out in his classic [Orthodoxy][1], radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person's philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess &quot;intelligence,&quot; based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn't have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the '70s (I'm still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we'll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn't even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn's 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the &quot;Artificial&quot; side of Artificial Intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't get me wrong: if I didn't think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn't be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can't engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we're conscious of its significance. I'd wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130" />

People with Type A personalities are often high-achieving &quot;workaholics.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of those attributes could conceivably be explicitly programmed in.

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how *he* thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that *this* particular movement is *this* gesture which means *this*), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture." />

This includes variants like Bidirectional, Jordan and Elman Networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a more sophisticated neural net algorithm which can accomplish the same time and sequence-based tasks, but which can leverage standard learning methods like backprop since it doesn't suffer from the &quot;vanishing gradient problem.&quot; This is because LSTMs have been brilliantly engineered as &quot;perfect integrators,&quot; which makes it a lot easier to calculate the error gradients etc. over long periods of time. In contrast, learning with RNNs is still not theoretically well-grounded and is difficult to calculate through existing methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). In Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs), the idea is to add new neurons and connections with each new training example across a stretch of time or training sequence; unfortunately, this places a practical limitation on how many examples you can feed into the net before the size of the network gets out of hand or it starts forgetting, just as with RNNs. LSTMs have much longer memories (especially when augmented with Neural Turing Machines) so that'd be my first choice, assuming I wanted to use neural nets for NLP purposes. My knowledge of the subject is limited though (I'm still trying to learn the ropes) so there may be other important neural net algorithms I'm overlooking..." />

The &quot;AGI&quot; must learn...and that learning process can take time. If you want an AGI to drive a car or play Go, you have to find some way of &quot;teaching&quot; it. Keep in mind that we have never built AGIs, so we don't know how long the training process can be, but it would be safe to assume pessimistic estimates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contrast that to a &quot;narrow intelligence&quot;. The narrow AI already knows how to drive a car or play Go. It has been programmed to be very excellent at one specific task. You don't need to worry about training the machine, because it has already been pre-trained.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A &quot;general intelligence&quot; seems to be more flexible than a &quot;narrow intelligence&quot;. You could buy an AGI and have it drive a car *and* play Go. And if you are willing to do more training, you can even teach it a new trick: *how to bake a cake*. I don't have to worry about unexpected tasks coming up, since the AGI will *eventually* figure out how to do it, given enough training time. I would have to wait a *long time* though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A &quot;narrow intelligence&quot; appears to be *more efficient* at its assigned task, due to it being programmed specifically for that task. It knows exactly what to do, and doesn't have to waste time &quot;learning&quot; (unlike our AGI buddy here). Instead of buying one AGI to handle a bunch of different tasks poorly, I would rather buy a bunch of specialized narrow AIs. Narrow AI #1 drives cars, Narrow AI #2 plays Go, Narrow AI #3 bake cakes, etc. That being said, this is a very brittle approach, since if some unexpected task comes up, none of my narrow AIs would be able to handle it. I'm willing to accept that risk though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is my &quot;thinking&quot; correct? Is there a trade-off between flexibility (AGI) and efficiency (narrow AI), like what I have just described above? Or is it theoretically possible for an AGI to be both flexible and efficient?" />

Therefore &quot;it's not depth, but the ensemble&quot; strikes me as a false dichotomy. You would really only say that if you honestly believed that you need hundreds or thousands of levels of abstraction to classify images with human accuracy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest you use the last wish for something else, maybe a pinacolada. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I still am, despite the fact that I have a few reservations about some of his philosophical musings on the meanings of consciousness, free will and other such topics. I won't elaborate on those misgivings here because they're not germane to the main, overwhelming reason why HTM nets haven't succeeded as much as expected to date: to my knowledge, Numenta has only implemented a truncated version of his vision. They left out most of the prediction architecture, which plays such a critical role in Hawkins' theories. As Gerod M. Bonhoff put it in [an excellent thesis][1][1] on HTMs, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;In March of 2007, Numenta released what they claimed was a “research&#xD;&#xA;&gt; implementation” of HTM theory called Numenta Platform for Intelligent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Computing (NuPIC). The algorithm used by NuPIC at this time is called&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Zeta1.” NuPIC was released as an open source software platform and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; binary files of the Zeta1 algorithm. Because of licensing, this paper&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is not allowed to discuss the proprietary implementation aspects of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Numenta’s Zeta1 algorithm. There are, however, generalized&#xD;&#xA;&gt; concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most&#xD;&#xA;&gt; important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each&#xD;&#xA;&gt; memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To&#xD;&#xA;&gt; implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each&#xD;&#xA;&gt; aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design&#xD;&#xA;&gt; decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept&#xD;&#xA;&gt; using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his&#xD;&#xA;&gt; theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling&#xD;&#xA;&gt; algorithms.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That's not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I've read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta's platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff's thesis and [Maltoni's technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory][2][2]. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton's famous maxim about Christianity, &quot;HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried.&quot; Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins' full vision of what an HTM should be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]Bonhoff, Gerod M., 2008, Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Detecting Anomalous Network Activity.

It does not mention technical methods such as neural networks but it gives a good history (and very nice stories) on what people had done on that field. It gives you the notion that in order to get achieve a better payoff, your goal is not actually making a better prediction but choosing the better options by considering what other players are doing. If you ask why it is not just the better prediction, the answer is that there is always a balance of risk and payoff and since you cannot find a 100% guaranteed way of prediction, you will have to balance risk and payoff in order to gain in the long run. In addition, although theory suggests that you can make a good prediction by gathering all variables, this is not really possible in practice. Thus, human assistance and observing what others are doing is used as a way to improve mathematical predictions and possible payoffs." />

This is a pretty classic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; problem - he finds a viable, not necessarily optimal but &quot;good enough&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; route using the A* algorithm, by taking the terrain layout and vehicle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; capabilities into account, and modifying a direct (straight) line path&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to account for these. The whole map is known a'priori and invariant,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; though the start and destination are arbitrary (user-chosen) and the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; path is not guaranteed to exist at all.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This cookie-cutter approach comes with a twist: limited storage space.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We can afford some more volatile memory on start, but we should free&#xD;&#xA;&gt; most of it once the route has been found. The travel may take days -&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the save file for custom data like this is severely limited. Too&#xD;&#xA;&gt; limited to save all the waypoints - even after culling trivial&#xD;&#xA;&gt; solution waypoints ('continue straight ahead'), and by a rather large&#xD;&#xA;&gt; margin, order of 20% the size of our data set.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A solution we came up with is to calculate the route once on start,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; then 'forget' all the trivial and 90% of the non-trivial waypoints.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This both serves as a proof that a solution exists, and provides a set&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of points reaching which, in sequence, guarantees the route will take&#xD;&#xA;&gt; us to the destination.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Once the vehicle reaches a waypoint, the route to the next one is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; calculated again, from scratch. It's known to exist and be correct&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (because we did it once, and it was correct), it doesn't put too much&#xD;&#xA;&gt; strain on the CPU and the memory (it's only about 10% the total route&#xD;&#xA;&gt; length) and it doesn't need to go into permanent storage (restarting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from any point along the path is just a subset of the solution&#xD;&#xA;&gt; connecting two saved waypoints).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---------------&#xD;&#xA;Now for the actual question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pathfinding algorithm follows a sparse set of waypoints which by themselves are not nearly sufficient as a route, but allow for easy, efficient  calculation of the actual route, simultaneously guarantying its existence; they are a subset of the full solution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this a heuristic approach?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(as I understand, normally, heuristics don't guarantee existence of a solution, and merely suggest more likely candidates. In this case, the 'hints' are taken straight out of an actual working solution, thus my doubts.)" />

And, again, while human intelligence _is_ an AMG, any given AMG that is optimized for generating machines of a particular type will be less optimized for generating machines of some other type(s). There's no free context. The most general search algorithm is a random walk - there is no way to _improve_ the generality of the random walk, other than just speeding it up.

And then there are those rare situations where I actually _want_ you to cut off my arm and put it on a pressure plate, perhaps to save a loved one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we could make a thing that could sympathize with what a human _might_ need in any given arbitrary situation, then we will have created either A) an artificial _human_ intelligence (AHI) (which could be more or less fallible, like a human), or B) an oracle that can reason about _all possible human needs_ on much faster than human time-scales - in which case you wouldn't _need_ a conscious AI, as all human needs and solutions could be pre-computed via formal specification, which is probably absurd to consider." />

A discrete universe can allow for apparent continuous behavior via approximation and randomness (or pseudorandomness), whereas a universe that is infinitely divisible affords no obvious definition of where things should start and end. This is one of the reasons many thinkers eschew considering infinities - they may be illusory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, can analog &quot;circuits&quot; execute faster than digital? As of right now, we know of some _seemingly_ analog phenomena that _appear_ execute faster than some digital phenomena (like electron spin vs a silicon logic gate). Whether analog phenomena are _intrinsically_ more efficient than digital depends on the actual nature of the universe, which we have not yet determined." />

Text="I am currently reading *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies* by Nick Bostrom. When he discusses whole brain emulation, although computing power (storage, bandwidth, CPU, body simulation, &amp; environment simulation) is one of the three general key things we are lacking toward its success, he also seems to agree that computing power is the most feasible and attainable of the three general issues we have for attaining it as of now. However he also goes on to to say &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Just how much technology is required for whole brain emulation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; depends on the level of abstraction at which the brain is simulated.&lt;sup&gt;[ref][1]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which is an interesting thought, but a whole different discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyways, so I think you are correct in thinking that we aren't far from having the computing power and maybe you are on to something, but rather are biggest hurdles are the other two key prerequisites that we need to attain before we can even begin trying, which are scanning, and translation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of the three, it would seem translation is the one we need to advance in the most, as of now. A modest prediction of attaining whole brain emulation is at least 15 years or mid century. Theres much more information in this book of all of the different paths that can be taken to achieve super intelligence, and it is well researched, I highly recommend it if you haven't read it already.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1mMJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41&amp;lpg=PT41&amp;dq=%22Just%20how%20much%20technology%20is%20required%20for%20whole%20brain%20emulation%20depends%20on%20the%20level%20of%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pmw4PUDele&amp;sig=PfmDRgcJuKBf3TwyCoVtCmp9XmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4gZy6tbnPAhVRF8AKHUoQDD8Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Just%20how%20much%20technology%20is%20required%20for%20whole%20brain%20emulation%20depends%20on%20the%20level%20of%22&amp;f=false" />

I'm not sure it translates well into AI though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems they're separating information from knowledge by splitting how from what. What is a superset of how, as far as I'm concerned. It's also a superset of why.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But from an evolutionary perspective, knowledge representation starts with why. Prior to a reason for knowledge representation, there is no knowledge representation. The 'what' existed, but it was not represented until autopoiesis created goal directed, why-oriented behaviors that began storing the what as knowledge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is a superset of why, just as ontology is a superset of teleology. However, all *represented* ontology was acquired through teleological (end-directed) action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I disagree with the notion that wisdom, as a why thing, is at the tip of the pyramid. It all started with goal directed behavior and that has been the source of all subsequent information growth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is wisdom? I think it is too much of a folk term to warrant a technical definition. If I had to just take a swing at a definition, though, I'd probably vote for wisdom being knowledge of the ontological basis of one's own teleological knowledge - essentially objectifying one's subjective interpretations - knowing the true what and how of the why, to whatever extent is possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have many *specific* references on this subject, but I thought Terrence Deacon's [Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter][1] was a good primer on teleology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_Nature" />

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually *is*. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence actually is and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don't know how to define &quot;intelligence&quot;, not due to people dismissing programs as not being &quot;intelligent&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this argument valid or correct?

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually *is*. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don't know how to define &quot;intelligence&quot;, not due to people dismissing programs as not being &quot;intelligent&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this argument valid or correct? And if not, why not?" />

If they did, they'd have basically solved AGI.  But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing I would consider trying (and I don't know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a [Bayesian Belief Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored &quot;knowledge&quot; as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you &quot;know&quot;, for example, that &quot;Reading is a city in the UK&quot; and that &quot;place names are usually capitalized&quot;, your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting &quot;Reading&quot; as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course I'm hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) isn't exactly a solved problem either.  But there are at least approaches out there that you could use.  For example, you could use the [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) / triple based approach from the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) world.  Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There has been a bit of research on &quot;probabilistic RDF&quot; that you could possibly use as a starting point.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://om.umiacs.umd.edu/material/papers/prdf.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-173/pos_paper5.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://www.w3.org/2005/03/07-yoshio-UMBC/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/paper/html/id/271/BayesOWL-Uncertainty-Modeling-in-Semantic-Web-Ontologies&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.pr-owl.org/&#xD;&#xA;" />

It is also generally ignored by researchers of Computational Creativity, who already have their own tests to evaluate creativity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Longer Answer:&#xD;&#xA;According to Google Scholar, there are 10 references to the &quot;Lovelace Test 2.0&quot; paper. All of those references exist merely to point out that the Lovelace Test 2.0 exists. In fact, at least two of articles I consulted ([A novel approach for identifying a human-like self-conscious behavior](http://philpapers.org/archive/NEGANA.pdf) and [FraMoTEC: A Framework for Modular Task-Environment Construction for Evaluating Adaptive Control Systems](http://users.dsic.upv.es/~flip/EGPAI2016/papers/EGPAI_2016_paper_8.pdf)) proposed their *own* tests instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the authors who wrote the FraMoTEC paper also wrote [his thesis on FraMoTEC](http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/25590/58121/1/scs-thorarensen2016-thesis.pdf), and indirectly critiqued the Lovelace Test 2.0 and other similar such tests:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Piaget-MacGyver Room problem [Bringsjord and Licato, 2012], Lovelace Test 2.0 [Riedl, 2014] and Toy Box problem [Johnston, 2010] all come with the caveat of being defined very vaguely — these evaluation methods may be likely to come up with a reasonable evaluation for intelligence, but it is very difficult to compare two different agents (or controllers) that partake in the their own domain-specific evaluations, which is what frequently happens when agents are tailored to pass specific evaluations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another major issue with the Lovelace Test 2.0 is that there is a proliferation of *other* tests to &quot;measure&quot; the creativity of AI. [Evaluating Evaluation: Assessing Progress in Computational Creativity Research](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/42374/1/jordanous-2011a.pdf), published by &#xD;&#xA;Anna Jordanous in 2011 (3 years *before* the invention of the Lovelace Test 2.0) analyzed research papers about AI creativity and wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Of the 18 papers that applied creativity evaluation methodologies to evaluate their system’s creativity, no one methodology emerged as standard across the community. Colton’s creative tripod framework ([Colton 2008](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd8b/d5bb76c94c4bfc34cb1fa244dc6bd4a8ca8e.pdf)) was used most often (6 uses), with 4 papers using Ritchie’s empirical criteria ([Ritchie 2007](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06d8/3be9078b5c8933c3523f0e663fff1c61e3a0.pdf)). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That leaves *10* papers with miscellaneous creativity evaluation methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of &quot;Evaluating Evaluation&quot; was to standardize the process of evaluating creativity, to avoid the possibility of the field stagnating due to the proliferation of so many creativity tests.  Anna Jordanous still remained interested in evaluating creativity tests, publishing articles such as [&quot;Stepping Back to Progress Forwards: Setting Standards for Meta-Evaluation of Computational Creativity&quot;](http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34328583/Stepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards-_Setting_Standards_for_Meta-Evaluation_of_Computational_Creativity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1475893195&amp;Signature=ox0%2FOEkNUNjz5pQg0w%2FOgzHPCsM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards_Setti.pdf) and [Four PPPPerspectives on Computational Creativity](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~map01mm/CC2015/AISB-CC2015-Proceedings.pdf#page=18).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Evaluating Evaluation&quot; does provide some commentary to explain the proliferation of systems to evaluate creativity:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Evaluation standards are not easy to define. It is difficult to evaluate creativity and even more difficult to describe how we evaluate creativity, in human creativity as well as in computational creativity. In fact, even the very definition of creativity is problematic (Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow 2004). It is hard to identify what ’being creative’ entails, so there are no benchmarks or ground truths to measure against.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fact that so many tests of creativity already exist (to the extent that Jordanous can make an academic career in studying them) means that it's very difficult for any new test (such as the Lovelace Test 2.0) to even be noticed (much less cited). Why would you want to use something like the Lovelace Test 2.0 when there's so many other tests you could use instead?" />

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence &quot;grow&quot;?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. &#xD;&#xA;[![Cell division][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.  Even though artificial intelligence can mimic and help sustain life, no artificial intelligence process is truly alive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do note I did not discuss [living systems][2] in my answer.          &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Definition of life][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.isss.org/primer/asem14ep.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21685/" />

Not every practical problem can be rephrased in terms of classification. Classification domain needs to be known upfront. Although the classification can be applied to any type of data, it's necessary to train the NN with samples of the specific domain where it'll be applied. If the domain is switched at some point, while keeping the same model (NN structure), it'll have to be retrained with new samples. Furthermore, even the best classifiers have &quot;gaps&quot; - [Adversarial Examples](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/07/deep-learning-adversarial-examples-misconceptions.html) can be easily constructed from a training sample, such that changes are imperceptible to human, but are misclassified by the trained model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

If there is a confusion about a certain aspect to intelligence, you haven't broken it down enough (in my experience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have managed to break it down very far and very deep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best part of finishing breaking it down, was that I did not have to worry about breaking down spoken language intelligence, as that is already well-successfully accomplished and there are APIs out there in which computational creativity researchers can use such as [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we *only* have to worry about breaking down the creativity aspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When beginning my development for the Artificial Intelligence at the age of 18 (hence the reason, not having high-educational knowledge of the field before today), I had just come out of high school with knowledge of how the design process works as an engineer, which I acquired from taking engineer courses in high (secondary) school. I also brought with me my own knowledge that I developed personally as a hobbyist programmer on browser-based integrated developer environments (to all non-programmers: here is a [google search on IDEs](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+integrated+development+environment) and [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where I got most of my knowledge from, so again, I am sorry community users for my incompetent lack of citations&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The Design Process:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**NOTE:** This I could easily provide a citation for, however it has too many accepted descriptions for me to be willing to cite one and to say that it is *the* or *a correct citation*. However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on [DiscoverDesign](https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps are *Define the Problem*, *Collect Information*, *Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas*, *Develop Solutions*, *Get Some Sort of Feedback*, *Improve* (which is essentially restart the process)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Defining a problem and How Curiosity works:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Defining the problem has a really easy solution (algorithm): ask for that from the client that you are designing for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this process could easily be made more interesting: Define *a problem* without user input. Essentially how will it come up with ideas or more specifically recognize problems on its own?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did some digging, and that relies on one question that lacks enough research for a **solid** answer, and that is where do questions come from psychologically?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More specifically, how does curiosity work? With more research on Google I was led to [this article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm) specifically addressing that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are *drive theory* and *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drive Theory simply states, we have a *need* to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions. So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Incongruity Theory* states that we are able identify things we *do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL* which leads us to asking questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a *missing/unclear attribute or characteristic* on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand). The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is by your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously looking at *similar ideas*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what I have designed is fairly simple. An idea is represented programmatically as an *object*. That object has certain characteristics known as *properties* (and essentially methods, but primarily and heavily-primarily properties). The program reads over those properties and finds other objects *similar* to it based on those properties. It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object *does not have*, and therefore marks those properties as unknown, making it possible to apply *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Collecting Information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is already achieved with *machine learning*, any questions on this topic need to be addressed to the [machine-learning tag](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Brainstorm Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyze Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to *induce* whether an idea is feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Develop Solutions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where my IDE knowledge comes in handy. In order to make product development *easy and understandable* to an AI, which is essentially a program, we would have to start by teaching it to develop program products soly, just to see how well the other algorithms work, considering that it only has to write in a program language, and program language rules are straight forward. and *very consistent* in comparison to spoken/written languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in order to do this it has to understand how to write a program. The most essential skill a computer program can have and needs to write a program is not a *dictionary of programming terms, functions, and commands*, but rather *knowledge of the syntactical rules* for a programming language. Which this technology is pretty much already available in IDE tech, and it is known as *syntactical highlighting*. All that would have to be done is to re-purpose it from *highlighting* to *assisting with writing*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Get Some Sort of Feedback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is essentially the same as analyzing the ideas, but now we would be using algorithms to analyze the final physical product as opposed to conceptual ideas." />

However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on [DiscoverDesign](https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The paragraph below is provided by them, and if you are interested in breaking that process down more, DiscoverDesign fully explains the processes in detail for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps are *Define the Problem*, *Collect Information*, *Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas*, *Develop Solutions*, *Get Some Sort of Feedback*, *Improve* (which is essentially restart the process)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Defining a problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as this part of the breakdown goes, there two algorithms in which you can use for this subprocess of design:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Easy Algorithm (not really an algorithm):* ask from the client what the Artificial Intelligence is providing a solution for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this process could easily be made more interesting:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Difficult Algorithm*: design an algorithm that can define *a problem* without user input.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did some digging, and the design of the latter relies on one question that lacks enough research for a **solid** answer, and that is *where do questions come from psychologically*? or *more specifically, how does curiosity work*?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With more research on Google I was led to [this article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm) specifically addressing that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###How Curiosity works:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are *drive theory* and *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Drive Theory simply states, we have a *need* to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Incongruity Theory* states that we are able identify things we *do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL* which leads us to asking questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a *missing/unclear attribute or characteristic* on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously looking at *other similar ideas* and looking at *their __clear__ attributes*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Solution Based on the Theory:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what I have designed is fairly simple:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***An idea*** is *represented programmatically as an __object__*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *The object* has certain characteristics known as *properties* (which are thos attributes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The program reads over those properties and finds other objects *similar* to it based on those properties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object *does not have*, and therefore marks those properties as unknown, making it possible to apply *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Collecting Information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is already achieved with *machine learning*, any questions on this topic need to be addressed to the [machine-learning tag](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Brainstorm Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyze Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to *induce* whether an idea is feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Develop Solutions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*In order to make product development* ***easy and understandable*** *to an AI*, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed **easily**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Editor's Note:* I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build.

However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on [DiscoverDesign](https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The paragraph below is provided by them, and if you are interested in breaking that process down more, DiscoverDesign fully explains the processes in detail for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steps are *Define the Problem*, *Collect Information*, *Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas*, *Develop Solutions*, *Get Some Sort of Feedback*, *Improve* (which is essentially restart the process)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Defining a problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as this part of the breakdown goes, there two algorithms in which you can use for this subprocess of design:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Easy Algorithm (not really an algorithm):* ask from the client what the Artificial Intelligence is providing a solution for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this process could easily be made more interesting:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Difficult Algorithm*: design an algorithm that can define *a problem* without user input.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I did some digging, and the design of the latter relies on one question that lacks enough research for a **solid** answer, and that is *where do questions come from psychologically*? or *more specifically, how does curiosity work*?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With more research on Google I was led to [this article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm) specifically addressing that question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###How Curiosity works:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are *drive theory* and *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Drive Theory simply states, we have a *need* to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Incongruity Theory* states that we are able identify things we *do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL* which leads us to asking questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a *missing/unclear attribute or characteristic* on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously is looking at *other similar ideas* and looking at *their __clear__ and __concisely known__ attributes*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Solution Based on the Theory:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what I have designed is fairly simple:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***An idea*** is *represented programmatically as an __object__*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *The object* has certain characteristics known as *properties* (which are those attributes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The program reads over those properties and finds other objects *similar* to it based on those properties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object *does not have*, and therefore marks those properties as unknown on the original object, making it possible to apply *incongruity theory*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Collecting Information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is already achieved with *machine learning*, any questions on this subprocess of design need to be addressed to the [machine-learning tag](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Brainstorming Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Analyzing Ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to *induce* whether an idea is feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Developing Solutions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*In order to make product development* ***easy and understandable*** *to an AI*, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed **easily**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *Editor's Note:* I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build. So, I only hope that you do not intend on copying it, but my artificial intelligence project is free and open-source, so there is no issue, if you do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Considering that written programs are very easy products to develop fully, and Considering that program language rules are straight forward. and *very consistent* in comparison to spoken/written languages, I chose to have it develop *programs*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in order to do this it has to understand how to write a program. The most essential skill a computer programmer can have and needs to write a program is not a *dictionary of programming terms, functions, and commands*, but rather *knowledge of the syntactical rules* for a programming language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The technological solution to this is pretty much already available in IDE tech, and it is known as *syntactical highlighting*. All that would have to be done is to re-purpose it from *highlighting* to *assisting with writing*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Getting Some Sort of Feedback.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is essentially the same as analyzing the ideas, but now we would be using algorithms to analyze the final physical product as opposed to conceptual ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Afterword Notes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am designing and researching into *computational creativity*, and I do want to mention that I just discovered this field of research is a thing by looking up the name [Mike Cook](https://live.newscientist.com/mike-cook/) on the internet, and that in order for me to help you, my answer does require lengthiness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paragraph 3 of the page found there [Mike Cook link] (listed at the time of 10/13/2016 at 8:28pm Arizona (USA) Time) that Mike Cook specializes in [computational creativity](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2LG2rNnPAhUQ82MKHcg0AgkQFggvMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computationalcreativity.net%2Ficcc2016%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK9E_tYBriAStd7HsIBjcf1KvQLg&amp;sig2=PD6wgisDW5YU3-224YGVYQ)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With further research this term was coined by the [ICCC 2016](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2LG2rNnPAhUQ82MKHcg0AgkQFggvMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computationalcreativity.net%2Ficcc2016%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK9E_tYBriAStd7HsIBjcf1KvQLg&amp;sig2=PD6wgisDW5YU3-224YGVYQ) according to [this google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=computational+creativity&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS700US700&amp;oq=computat&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3974j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) made by myself at that time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, google did not further provide me with any products actually being made within this field of research, so I would therefore like to discuss mine as it is open-source under a MIT-license.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Note to Community:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do want to make clear that I am providing this answer out of helpfulness, and I do understand that it has no credibility, as the product I am using (as an example) is my own.

The output of running this model on a new datapoint _x_ is not the same type as _x_, but instead a classification label.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, time series models learn parameters that symbolize how vectors in the input relate to each other, rather than raw inputs themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for how they learn, the structures are mathematical objects whose fitness is determined by the input data.

It could profile users to see ehat tasks are done most often, how many steps are needed.  Then when it recognizes that task recurring, it could ask the user if they wanted it to execute a macro that did the following [then it presents then with a list of the steps, allowing them to edit as needed].  Then it executes the 'macro' that it learned from observing the user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another use of AI is error detection, not only in the software, but in user error when the software was used inefficiently, redundantly, or improperly.  If the software were designed such that it was given a set of models of user tasks (like AI plans), it could observe users in the way they achieve known tasks, and offer suggestions or ask for confirmation that imminent unusual outcomes are intended.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And of course, AI could be used extensively in user interface design, on devices, web sites, or apps.

As conversations with apps that can add their own data and models of tasks/concepts/domains develop further, the need for AI *inside* the app will only grow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a *ton* of ways that AI could be used in apps.  A few of these have started to arise in mobile devices and their apps, usually in fusion of user mobility with external web-based databases (e.g. GPS and maps), but IMO it's been slow." />

Decision trees usually works well in a turn-based game with a good heuristic function, but in RTS games takes a different approach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of a very complex RTS game, one could implemented a rule-based AI. For example&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - given it is the early game use all units to scout for resources&#xD;&#xA; - if a certain criteria is met build the base a certain way&#xD;&#xA; - if another criteria is met build an army&#xD;&#xA; - if the army is big enough, attack&#xD;&#xA; - if being attacked by the enemy, bring the units back to the base to defend&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each of these rules could implement various other AI technique, for example use A-star to find the optimal path between a unit's current location and destination.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further optimization could be done by &quot;grouping&quot; similar units to act like one unit. e.g. calculate the path for the entire group instead of each individual unit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could also add finer grained rules, like if enemy is a certain distance from a unit, move closer and attack or retreat to the base (depending on health, ammo, abilities, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The benefit of this approach is that a rule-based system executes very fast as no training or decision trees are necessary and this frees up a lot of system resources for visuals like physics and graphics.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The disadvantage is that if the rule system is not complex enough, the player will easily recognize the pattern and the game will become predictable and boring.  You will also notice that the more different units you add to the game, the exponentially more complex the rule system becomes as you have to cater and test interaction between each type of unit in the game otherwise players might find a weakness in the game design and exploit to complete missions in ways it was not designed to be completed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the reasons why multi-player games are so popular is that you do not play against set rules, but against creative people who have the ability to comes up with new strategies you had never seen before." />

For a human, there are basically three computations: `r1 = x*x`, `r2 = r1 + 1`, `r3 = sin(r2)`. Even if you have 3 people working on calculating the result, you will not be faster than the single fastest person in this group is. Why? Because you need the results of the last computation. " />

The GAN learns by passing the loss function to both networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How do the discriminative (D) neural nets initially know whether the data produced by G is correct or not? Do we have to train the D first then add it into the GAN with G?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's consider my trained D net, which can classify a picture with 90% percentage accuracy. If we add this D net to a GAN there is a 10% probability it will classify a image wrong. If we train a GAN with this D net then will it also have the same 10% error in classifying an image?

Keep in mind that this only answers the part of the question pertaining to NTMs, not Google DeepMind itself, plus I'm still learning the ropes in machine learning, so some of the material in these papers is over my head; I did manage to grasp much of the material in [Graves et al.'s original paper][1]{1] though and am close to having homegrown NTM code to test. I also at least skimmed the following papers over the last few months; they do not replicate the NTM study in a strict scientific manner, but many of their experimental results do tend to support the original at least tangentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• In [this paper][2] on a variant version of NTM addressing, Gulcehere, et al. do not try to precisely replicate Graves et al.'s tests, but like the DeepMind team, it does demonstrate markedly better results for the original NTM and several variants over an ordinary recurrent LSTM. They use 10,000 training samples of a Facebook Q&amp;A dataset, rather than the N-grams Graves et al. operated on in their paper, so it's not replication in the strictest sense. They did however manage to get a version of the original NTM and several variants up and running, plus recorded the same magnitude of performance improvement.[2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• Unlike the original NTM, [this study][3] tested a version of reinforcement learning which was not differentiable; that may be why they were unable to solve several of the programming-like tasts, like Repeat-Copy, unless the controller wasn't confined to moving forwards. Their results were nevertheless good enough to lend support to the idea of NTMs. A more recent revision of their paper is apparently available, which I have yet to read, so perhaps some of their variant's problems have been solved.[3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• Instead of testing the original flavor of NTM against ordinary neural nets like LSTMs, [this paper][4] pitted it against several more advanced NTM memory structures. They got good results on the same type of programming-like tasks that Graves et al. tested, but I don't think they were using the same dataset (it's hard to tell from the way their study is written just what datasets they were operating on).[4] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• On p. 8 of [this study][5], an NTM clearly outperforms several LSTM, feed-forward and nearest-neighbor based schemes on an Omniglot character recognition dataset. An alternative approach to external memory cooked up by the authors clearly beats it, but it still obviously performs well. The authors seem to belong to a rival team at Google, so that might be an issue when assessing replicability.[5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• On p. 2 [these authors][6] reported getting better generalization on &quot;very large sequences&quot; in a test of copy tasks, using a much smaller NTM network they evolved with the genetic NEAT algorithm, which dynamically grows topologies.[6]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NTMs are fairly new so there hasn't been much time to stringently replicate the original research yet, I suppose. The handful of papers I skimmed over the summer, however, seem to lend support to their experimental results; I have yet to see any that report anything but excellent performance. Of course I have an availability bias, since I only read the pdfs I could easily find in a careless Internet search. From that small sample it seems that most of the follow-up research has been focused on extending the concept, not replication, which would explain the lack of replicability data.

Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is to vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's &quot;not even false&quot;. If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question. And what I'm hoping for are answers that go beyond the *a fortiori* reply &quot;Our brain is so powerful and dynamic, it's great for *any* task, and so also for processing sensorimotor information&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My second question is basically the same but instead of the human brain I want to ask for neural networks. What are the properties of neural networks that makes them *particularly* suitable for processing the kind of information that is produced by a body? Here are some of the reasons why people think neural networks are powerful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The universal approximation theorem (of FFNNs)&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to learn and self-organise&#xD;&#xA; - Robustness to local degrading of information&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to abstract/coarse-grain/convolute features, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I see how these are real advantages when it comes to evolution picking its favorite model for an embodied AI, none of them (or their combination) seems to be unique to neural networks. So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation? For instance, I really don't see how neural networks would be a particularly natural choice for dealing with geometric information. But geometric information is pretty vital when it comes to sensorimotor information, no?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking forward to your answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

It can change with time, reference to topic of discussion or something else. Today, one parameter to its definition is _mortality_. In future if we reach to a certain technological level where mortal beings were only part of history, then the definition will drop **this** parameter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Coming to the second question. AI started as field of study to make machines to think like humans (or take rational decisions). Giving life to machines was, or is, not a concern of AI developers (at-least not nowadays). Once I watched some videos of Michio Kaku, where he talked about consciousness along with AI.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Suppose human has a conscious level of 10. Then a thermostat might have the conscious level of 1 as it can sense when the surrounding is hot or cold and then take decision. Similarly a rat can have a conscious level 7 (or something). And the levels are of exponential order (not a linear scale). Similarly you can develop an AI program and check what level of consciousness it has achieved. Then you can decide whether it is living or not. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) will have a lower level of consciousness level than AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) will have consciousness level higher than the other two, and way higher than any human being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;To judge whether an AI program is living or not you need a concrete definition of **&quot;LIFE&quot;**. Your definition can include various parameters like consciousness, adaptability, metabolism (or another method of generating energy for use), rational behavior, intelligence , learning through experience, etc. etc. etc.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;But the thing in the end is that its your definition. There are many definitions of &quot;LIFE&quot; out there. You can't judge a program for life by all definitions, as some of the definitions are contrary to others.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So, answer to whether an AI program is living or not, is that **IT DEPENDS**.

If you ask why that makes them powerful, well, that's just the structure of the world. If you are stalked by a wolf, it's not like its upper jaw will attack you frontally, while his lower jaw will attack you from behind. If you want to respond to the threat with a feasible computational effort, you'll have to treat the wolf as one entity. Providing these kinds of entities or concepts from the raw bits and bytes of input is what a hierarchical representation does. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this is quite intuitive for sensory information: lashes, iris, eyebrow make up an eye, eyes, nose and mouth make up a face and so on. What is less obvious, is the fact that motor control works exactly the same way! Only in reverse. If you want to lift your arm, you'll just lift it. But for your brain to actually realise this move, the high level command has to be broken down into precise signals for every muscle involved. And this is done by propagating the command down the hierarchy. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the brain these two functions are strongly intertwined. You use constant sensory feedback to adapt your motor control and in many cases you'd be incapable of integrating your stream of sensory data into a coherent representation if you didn't have the additional information of what your body is doing to change that stream of data. [Saccades][1] are a good example for that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course this doesn't mean that our cognitive functions are dependent on the processing of sensorimotor information. I would be surprised if a pure thinking machine wouldn't be possible. There is however a specific version of this &quot;embodied intelligence hypothesis&quot; that sounds plausible to me: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Creating high level cognitive concepts with unsupervised learning is a really difficult problem. Creating high level motor representation might be significantly easier. The reason is that there is more immediate useful feedback. I have been thinking about how to provide a scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts and one thing I could imagine is that high level cognitive concepts basically hitch a ride with the motor concepts. Just think of what a pantomime can express with movement alone. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" />

Text="There is this claim around that the brain's cognitive capabilities are tightly linked to the way it processes sensorimotor information and that, in this or a similar sense, our intelligence is &quot;embodied&quot;. Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is too vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's &quot;not even false&quot;. If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question. And what I'm hoping for are answers that go beyond the *a fortiori* reply &quot;Our brain is so powerful and dynamic, it's great for *any* task, and so also for processing sensorimotor information&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My second question is basically the same but instead of the human brain I want to ask for neural networks. What are the properties of neural networks that makes them *particularly* suitable for processing the kind of information that is produced by a body? Here are some of the reasons why people think neural networks are powerful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The universal approximation theorem (of FFNNs)&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to learn and self-organise&#xD;&#xA; - Robustness to local degrading of information&#xD;&#xA; - their ability to abstract/coarse-grain/convolute features, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I see how these are real advantages when it comes to evolution picking its favorite model for an embodied AI, none of them (or their combination) seems to be unique to neural networks. So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation? For instance, I really don't see how neural networks would be a particularly natural choice for dealing with geometric information. But geometric information is pretty vital when it comes to sensorimotor information, no?" />

If having one light-sensitive cell connected to one muscle cell makes an organism more likely to survive, then you have the building blocks to add a second layer without inventing any new sorts of cells, because you already have the information-processing connector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neural networks are convenient for evolution because their organization matches the hierarchical nature of the problem *and* the same kind of cell is used everywhere. All you need is dendrites to receive signals, a way to compute the threshold and trigger if the received signal is higher, axons that can make it to other cells, and then branches at the end of the axon to serve as multipliers. You can arbitrarily extend the depth and breadth of the network just by adding more cells.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because they give you, in memory, access to lots of intermediate values. They're also convenient for the same reasons evolution found them convenient--we can just say what we expect the structure of the robotic control will look like, provide training data, and then eventually have a robot that works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there's lots of robotics where the control system is designed instead of learned. To take a very simple example, one *could* use machine learning on the thermostat problem, to learn what temperatures require the heater to be turned on and what temperatures require the air conditioner to be turned on. But this would be extra work *and* a less robust system than just designing the optimal control system ahead of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In control theory, there's a concept called [adaptive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control), where one of the state space parameters for the control system is a property of the system. For example, imagine a satellite; typically we think of the state space of the system as the position and velocity of the satellite in three dimensions, so six total coordinates. There's then a set of differential equations that describe how the satellite will move over time, and what would happen if we used the actuators on the satellite to change its velocity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But part of those differential equations is the inertia of the satellite. That is, how much fuel we need to expend and how it'll affect the rotation and translation of the satellite depends on where the weight of the satellite is located. And this can change over time, as fuel is consumed or if it wasn't correctly measured to begin with. Adaptive control adds new states to the system to track the inertia, and then simultaneously updates its estimate of the inertia and uses that estimate to plan what controls are necessary to move to a desired position.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could imagine solving this problem with neural networks, but we can fairly easily calculate the optimal solution from first principles. In that case, we don't need neural network-based control, but the end result will look something like it from the outside." />

Of course, thinking that I can apply the techniques above easily in my scenarios was stupid. All examples above are based on convolutional nets (image recognition) and some other assumptions, which might not be applicable in my scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can you give me hints or futher articles, which deal with my questions below? As a beginner, I do not have an overview, yet. Preferably, your suggestions should also be connected to the following areas already: deep learning, reinforcement learning (, multiagent systems)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a card game and the AI shall play a card from its hand, you could think about the cards (amongst other stuff) as the current game state. You can easily define some sort of neural net and feed it with the card data. In a trivial case the cards are just numbered. I do not know the net type, which would be suitable, but I guess deep reinforcment learning strategies could be applied easily then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I can only imagine this, if there is a constant number of hand cards. In the examples above, the number of pixels is also constant, for example. What if a player can have a different numbers of cards? What to do, if a player can have an infinite number of cards? Of course, this is just a theoretical question as no game has an infinite number of cards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the initial examples, the action space is constant. What can you do, if the action space is not? This more or less follows from my previous problem. If you have 3 cards, you can play card 1, 2 or 3. If you have 5 cards, you can play card 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, etc. It is also common in card games, that it is not allowed to play a card. Could this be tackled with negative reward?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, which &quot;tricks&quot; can be used, e.g. always assume a constant number of cards with &quot;filling values&quot;, which is only applicable in the non-infinite case (anyways unrealistic and even humans could not play well with that)?&#xD;&#xA;Are there articles, which examine such things already?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05521&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08779.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/" />

Text="**AlphaGo** is the most sophisticated and closet human creation towards an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is a computer program that is **developed by Google DeepMind** to play the board game &quot;Go&quot;. The game is different than other games, as **The number of potential legal board positions is greater than the number of atoms in the universe**. It has way more legal board positions than the chess. So, _AlphaGo_ requires different technique for it's development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Program's victories against the best players in the world in March 2016 **is considered a major break through** in the field of AI. Go was previously considered to be a hard problem and many experts believed that current technology is not enough. Experts were saying that it will take atleast 5 years (or may be 10 years) before we will have a well developed Go software player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;The game used sophisticated algorithms of deep learning and reinforcement learning in order to learn the game. What makes this game different from other board game (like Chess, Reversi, etc.) is that moves are often based on intuition. If you ask a Chess player why he make a certain move, you will always be hearing an answer where he will explain you how he thought this move can increase in change of winning. Every move uses certain heuristics, strategy and/ or tricks. This is not the case with Go. Some moves are often taken because of intuition. Coding an AI software that can play a game, where intuition is a integral part of the game makes it different from other AIs that we have today.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; At present AlphaGo is the closest AI software to Artificial General Intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can go through these links for more information:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

Rather than tying itself into moral and ethical knots in a crisis, Mercedes-Benz simply intends to program its self-driving cars to save the people inside the car. Every time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; All of Mercedes-Benz’s future Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous cars will prioritize saving the people they carry, according to Christoph von Hugo, the automaker’s manager of driver assistance systems and active safety.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There article also contains the following fascinating paragraph.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A study released at midyear [by Science][2] magazine didn’t clear the air, either. The majority of the 1928 people surveyed thought it would be ethically better for autonomous cars to sacrifice their occupants rather than crash into pedestrians. Yet the majority also said they wouldn’t buy autonomous cars if the car prioritized pedestrian safety over their own.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://blog.caranddriver.com/self-driving-mercedes-will-prioritize-occupant-safety-over-pedestrians/&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6293/1514" />

If we want to know if a new sample belongs to class A or B, we will compare it to each model and decide. The advantage is that we are able to synthetically generate more samples of these classes using the generative property of the model. The models have a &quot;global knowledge&quot; of what the classes are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, a discriminative model will &quot;pay attention&quot; to what differentiates the 2 classes. It is more straightforward and often computationally less expensive as the model does not need to grasp everything about each class but only what makes them different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is for the big picture.

An so we consult the grammar rule book, and settle for the meaning ( indefinite article any one of ), you have to parse the next word  and refer to it though, but let's gloss over that for now, and finally (**triumph**) a noun ( it could also be a verb, but thanks to the grammar rule book we settled for a noun with meaning: ( victory,conquest), so in the end we have ( joining the meanings ):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A specific thing occurred of victory.** Close enough and I am glossing over a few other rules, but that's not the point, the other strategy is:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A lexical dictionary (or lexicon)**&#xD;&#xA;Where words or sounds are associated with specific meaning. Here meaning is derived from one or more words or sounds as a unit. This introduces the problem to a parser, since well, it shouldn't parse anything.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;E.G. ***&quot;Non Plus Ultra&quot;*** And so the AI parser would recognize that this phrase is not to be parsed and instead matched with meaning :&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The highest point or culmination&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lexical units introduce another issue in that they themselves could be part of the first example, and so you end up with recursion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; if it is possible for a computer to parse a well-versed sentence written in English as if it were parsed by an adult English-speaking human?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe it could be possible, most examples I've seen deal effectively with the grammar rule book or the lexicon part, but I am not aware of a combination of both, but in terms of programming, it could happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately even if you solve this problem, your AI would not really understand things in the strict sense, but rather present you with very elaborate synonyms, additionally context (as mentioned in the comments) plays a role into the grammar and lexicon strategies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If it cannot be represented using simple grammar rules, what kind of semantic structure can be used to generalize it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A mixed one where there are both grammar rules and a lexicon and both can change and be influenced based on the AI specific context and experience as well as a system for dealing with these objects could be one way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;  " />

For example, development of human-like natural language processing (NLP) is necessary for intelligent agent to pass any verbal tests, or even non-verbal tests that requires processing of sentences of human language. Famous test that tests intelligence by asking questions in natural language and expects answers in the same form is Turing test. NLP still struggles with many (basic) human skills like listening, speaking, parsing and forming sentences. No one knows when we'll have system that can do these things as good as human. Since this system is crucial, but also far from human-like it's likely cause of delay in developing AI that passes intelligence test. Are these problems AI-hard? Do we need to develop strong AI to solve them?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can look at speech and listening as interfaces used for expressing and affecting inner processes of human brain. Same goes for other senses like eyesight which is being approximated by computer vision. One could say that we only need to develop convincing mimics of human senses and incorporate them in one big system that will become first human-like AI. That is the minimum requirement. **I doubt this will be achieved in this century.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Other thoughts)&lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;What truly defines intelligence is brain activity. Since it's really complex and one artificial neuron is not equal to one neuron in brain, increase in computation power will not necessarily help achieving human-like AI. Also recognizing such system by mere intelligence test is questionable. For now it's only philosophical discussion but by the time we are able to design such machine I think we'll also have better understanding of human brain. Someone in 2100 might not read this answer on quantum computer with integrated AI OS powered from fusion reactor in his self-flying car, but will probably have many systems that help him in everyday tasks far more than we imagine today." />

[Artificial neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) typically use exemplar data as inputs for the purpose of training, or adjusting the weights of its internal connections, to accurately correctly classify them within a certain error range. The network is then applied to unknown data to classify it. [Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) filters are just blind operators that transform input data regardless of how it can be classified. There is no training, so any intelligence exists only in the mind of the filter developer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. A CNN could be trained to be an effective Sobel (edge detection) filter, as described [in this paper](http://www.worldacademicunion.com/journal/1746-7659JIC/jicvol5no1paper01.pdf), but a Sobel filter couldn't be an effective learning algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Training neural networks is more non-deterministic, with outputs depending on what data they are trained with and potentially even the operational computations that are used for classification. Applying filters is typically deterministic, i.e. they will transform the same data exactly the same way if applied twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One short way of expressing the biggest difference is: a cellular neural network is looking for a function, while a Sobel filter *is* a function.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there are types of neural networks called Convolutional Neural Networks, which can use Sobel and other filters in their input layers, as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). Though, these are neither of the things you are asking about. :)" />

Apply the found solutions to the issue&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example is here the problem of marketing a shopping mall: A Shopping mall has many rooms and floors (1). A museum has also many rooms and floors (2). How are museums marketed? They present many pictures or sculptures (3). We could use our rooms and floors to decorate them with pictures and sculptures (4).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course the idea to implement that as an artifically intelligent algorithm was not far. However, I feel a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of methods that exist out there. Neural Networks, Bayesian Interference and so on... My current experience doesn't go further than simple machine learning like kMeans-Clustering for example. Do you think it would be very hard to find a solution for this problem? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm thinking of a console application, where you can enter a conceptualized problem like &quot;methods for creative writing&quot;, for example, and it uses the above method to find possible solutions of the issue. Of course no solution with extensive depth, more something like basic ideas derived from the knowledge database I have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets take as an example a console application where someone asks &quot;how to write a novel&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. It should find out first that the system all is about is in the term &quot;novel&quot;. To find a feature of that system it just searches concepts containing that term: it finds out &quot;Novel is a story&quot; So thats a feature.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Which systems are also stories? A good concept it should find is e.g. &quot;Plot is a story&quot;. (Of course only when I am selecting the search results manually)--&gt; **How to find best concepts of a list when not knowing which fits best?**&#xD;&#xA; 3. It should then find out that a plot is written using a storyline: &quot;storyline is a plot&quot;&#xD;&#xA; 4. One possible answer of the AI would in this case be: &quot;By writing a storyline&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you know some helpful libraries, algorithms or other resources that might help me?

[Artificial neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) typically use exemplar data as inputs for the purpose of training, or adjusting the weights of its internal connections, to accurately classify them within a certain error range. The network is then applied to unknown data to classify them. [Edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) filters are just blind operators that transform input data regardless of how it can be classified. There is no training, so any intelligence exists only in the mind of the filter developer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. A CNN could be trained to be an effective Sobel (edge detection) filter, as described [in this paper](http://www.worldacademicunion.com/journal/1746-7659JIC/jicvol5no1paper01.pdf), but a Sobel filter couldn't be an effective learning algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Training neural networks is more non-deterministic, with outputs depending on what data they are trained with and potentially even the operational computations that are used for classification. Applying filters is typically deterministic, i.e. they will transform the same data exactly the same way if applied twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One succinct way of expressing the biggest difference is: a cellular neural network is looking for a function, while a Sobel filter *is* a function.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that there are types of neural networks called Convolutional Neural Networks, which can use Sobel and other filters in their input layers, as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). Though, these are neither of the things you are asking about. :)" />

It will use the same method which every organism uses: any input is true and real, unless you misidentified some other stuff as &quot;input&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would define input as: what crosses the boundary and enters your mind from outside of your mind. The minimum hardwired check is to make sure that signals generated inside a mind are not misidentified as coming from outside (aka &quot;I hear voices&quot;). That's all. This is where the blockchain of truth begins and where it ends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An Internet article? The input to AI is rather: one of AI's network interfaces received many bytes. Once it's verified they are from the network, and not imaginary, they cannot be unreal or untrue in any meaningful way. By that definition of input, it is in fact the *only* thing we can be sure is true and real.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course AI will likely form hypotheses regarding these bytes that happen to contain ASCII strings like &quot;Trump&quot;, &quot;John Smith&quot;, &quot;ice balls on Siberian beaches&quot;. Then AI will hopefully make predictions based on these hypotheses, maybe interact, maybe get some new input, reject the hypothesis and make a new one, rinse and repeat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first hypothesis will be super-naive, but the hundredth, the thousandth?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you end this process prematurely - maybe for lack of processing power -  you will get something you called a &quot;*belief*&quot;.

That *belief* is a synonym of &quot;tired with trying new hypotheses, will stick to this one&quot;. Typical human thing. AI will have less of that, I hope, due to having much much more processing capabilities. AI will stick less to the high-school-level truth that you should assign great credibility to statements written in a form of a newspaper article, it will hopefully form more and more generations of hypotheses, and check them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In effect AI will depend less on *believing* various statements generated in the outside world.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual &quot;feeling&quot; is not required for fulfilling any of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of &quot;normal&quot; boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of &quot;strong&quot; emotions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience. Psychopaths &quot;enjoy&quot; what they do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am strongly suggesting to all that we are blinded by our reasoning, and by the reasoning of others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though I do agree with the following quote mentioned before: -&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Dave H. wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    From a computational standpoint, emotions represent global state that influences a lot of other processing. Hormones etc. are basically just implementation. A sentient or sapient computer certainly could experience emotions, if it was structured in such a way as to have such global states affecting its thinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, his reasoning below it (that quote) is also seriously flawed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emotions are both active and passive: They are triggered by thoughts and they trigger our thoughts; Emotions are a mental state and a behaviourial quality; Emotions react to stimuli or measure our responses to them; Emotions are independant regulators and moderators; Yet they provoke our focus and attention to specific criteria; and they help us when intuition and emotion agree or they hinder us when conscience or will clash.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A computer has the same potential as us to feel emotions, but the skill of implementing emotions is much more sophisticated than the one solution fits all answer people are seeking here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if anyone argues that emotions are simply &quot;states&quot; where a response or responses can be designed around it, really does not understand the complexity of emotions; the &quot;freedom&quot; emotions and thoughts have independently of each other; or what constitutes true thought!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Programmers and scientists are notorious for &quot;simulating&quot; the real experiences of emotions or intelligence, without understanding the intimate complexities; Thinking that in finding the perfect simulation they have &quot;discovered&quot; the real experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Psi-theory seems to adequately give a proper understanding of the matter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi-theory&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I would say that the simulation of emotional states &quot;is&quot; equivalent to experiencing emotions, but those emotional states are far more complex than what most realise.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is a far different dynamic set of circumstances than what has been touted above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if it was claimed by a woman that a man raped her - which was not reported to the police - it is not enough to compare one person's statements to another in order to determine truth. This is because collusion, influenced or coherced third parties, mistaken perceptions and false beliefs would give false positives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if an AI could establish from her statement that on the day she claimed to have been raped, that the alleged assailant was incapacitated while in her company, until she left his home, because the police report stated that she was upset with the assailant because he was asleep because of drugs during her whole stay. But, this police report comes from an independent source who states, Mr. &quot;x&quot; was asleep that day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Doing a strict textual check is not going to give the correct answers. analysing her friends and associattes chatter could also confirm a false report as being true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, an AI has to have the ability to &quot;test&quot; written reports outside of the criteria of what was spoken.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual &quot;feeling&quot; is not required for fulfilling any of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of &quot;normal&quot; boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of &quot;strong&quot; emotions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience. Psychopaths &quot;enjoy&quot; what they do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am strongly suggesting to all that we are blinded by our reasoning, and by the reasoning of others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Though I do agree with the following quote mentioned before: -&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dave H. wrote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; From a computational standpoint, emotions represent global state that influences a lot of other processing. Hormones etc. are basically&#xD;&#xA;&gt; just implementation. A sentient or sapient computer certainly could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; experience emotions, if it was structured in such a way as to have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; such global states affecting its thinking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, his reasoning below it (that quote) is also seriously flawed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emotions are both active and passive: They are triggered by thoughts and they trigger our thoughts; Emotions are a mental state and a behaviourial quality; Emotions react to stimuli or measure our responses to them; Emotions are independant regulators and moderators; Yet they provoke our focus and attention to specific criteria; and they help us when intuition and emotion agree or they hinder us when conscience or will clash.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A computer has the same potential as us to feel emotions, but the skill of implementing emotions is much more sophisticated than the one solution fits all answer people are seeking here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, if anyone argues that emotions are simply &quot;states&quot; where a response or responses can be designed around it, really does not understand the complexity of emotions; the &quot;freedom&quot; emotions and thoughts have independently of each other; or what constitutes true thought!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Programmers and scientists are notorious for &quot;simulating&quot; the real experiences of emotions or intelligence, without understanding the intimate complexities; Thinking that in finding the perfect simulation they have &quot;discovered&quot; the real experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Psi-theory seems to adequately give a proper understanding of the matter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi-theory&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I would say that the simulation of emotional states &quot;is&quot; equivalent to experiencing emotions, but those emotional states are far more complex than what most realise.&#xD;&#xA;" />

However, what your definition of *plugged in* is unclear. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean literally, and *physically*, plugged in to the wall then **yes**, as [Aus points out](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401), because one can use a battery, or have a solar powered circuit, or petrol/diesel/steam/water/wind/hydrogen/etc. powered engine, running a generator/alternator which can eventually supply a voltage and current to power the circuitry. However, in these examples, you have merely moved the point of generation, from a remote power station to a locally generated source of electricity - so it is still, in effect, *plugged in* (but to a local source). So, in that sense, the answer is **no**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean no external power source, ***what so ever***, then the answer is most certainly **no**, as, again as [Aus has already said](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401), there is no way for electrons to be pushed around the circuit, and therefore the circuit is dead&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you mean, as you said in your [comment](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#comment-2620) that the AI has created its own electrical power source - although as [Ankur says in their answer](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401), this implies that the AI has the ability for its I/O manipulate its environment&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - then as in the first paragraph, you have simply moved the point of the power source, so one can say that it is again now *plugged in*, again to a local energy source, and so yet again the answer is **no**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you are *not* referring to an electronic based computer, which is hosting the AI, but are, instead, referring to a *hypothetical biological* computer, then the answer is probably **yes** - in a sense. Although, that biological computer would still require energy input, as energy can't just be &quot;magicked&quot; out of thin air. It would need to be converted from one source into a from that the biological computer can use. That energy could come from a variety of sources, be it from sunlight, food,  heat (sunlight, deep sea vents, etc), so one could argue that it is still *plugged in* to an *energy source* and so yet again, the answer is **no**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be honest, in order to give an accurate, and sensible answer, you really need to reword your question, clarify what you mean and what your definitions of *plugged in* and *AI host* are.

Unless you're up for a real challenge this is probably what you should do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, it is _possible_ to build a single CNN that takes input of images as varying dimensions.  There are a number of ways you might try to do this, and I'm not aware of any published science analyzing these different choices.  The key is that the set of learned parameters needs to be shared between the different inputs sizes.  While convolutions can be applied at different images sizes, ultimately they always get converted to a single vector to make predictions with, and the size of that vector will depend on the geometries of the inputs, convolutions and pooling layers.  You'd probably want to dynamically change the pooling layers based on the input geometry and leave the convolutions the same, since the convolutional layers have parameters and pooling usually doesn't.  So on bigger images you pool more aggressively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Practically you'd want to group together similarly (identically) sized images together into minibatches for efficient processing.  This is common for LSTM type models.  This technique is commonly called &quot;bucketing&quot;.

At the end it should also display the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; best solution found.    &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You may use the following operators:  &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1.  Reproduction.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; You can use either one of the following reproduction&#xD;&#xA;&gt; types:  Proportional, Ranking, Tournament. They are described more in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; detail below:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2.  Crossing over.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In order to perform this operation the individuals must be grouped in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pairs (randomly), and  with certain probability pcross information&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from their chromosomes must be exchanged. There  are many flavors of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the crossing-over operator, but in our case (short, 16-bit&#xD;&#xA;&gt; chromosome),  simple, one-point crossover will be enough. It can be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; performed by selecting a random  number k from the range &lt;1;15&gt; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cutting the chromosomes of both individuals on that  position. Each of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the individuals copies bits &lt;k;16&gt; belonging to the other to it’s own &#xD;&#xA;&gt; chromosome.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3.  Mutation  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This operator changes the value of each bit in the chromosome to the opposite one with a very  small probability pm&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (usually about 10-3).  If we denote chromosome as [b1, b2, ... , b16];&#xD;&#xA;&gt; then after the mutation each bit can be  described as:  Where k Î&#xD;&#xA;&gt; {1,2, ...,16}  flip(x) – result of a Bernoulli flip with a success &#xD;&#xA;&gt; probability x.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here I see that by Reproduction and Crossover he means different things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is the catch?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ccbso.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_operator#Operators&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/genetic-algorithms/crossover-mutation.php&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/genetic_algorithms/genetic_algorithms_fundamentals.htm" />

Text="Firstly, an AGI could conceivably exhibit all of the observable properties of intelligence without being conscious. Although that may seem counter-intuitive, at present we have no physical theory that allows us to detect consciousness (philosophically speaking, a ['Zombie'][1] is indistinguishable from a non-Zombie - see the writing of [Daniel Dennett][2] and [David Chalmers][3] for more on this). Destroying a non-conscious entity has the same moral cost as destroying a chair.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, note that 'destroy' doesn't necessarily mean the same for entities with *persistent substrate*, i.e. their 'brain state' can be reversibly serialized to some other storage medium and/or multiple copies of them can co-exist. So if by 'destroy' we simply mean 'switch off', then an AGI might conceivably be reassured of a subsequent re-awakening. Douglas Hofstadter gives an interesting description of such an 'episodic consciousness' in [&quot;A Conversation with Einstein's Brain&quot;][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If by 'destroy', we mean 'irrevocably erase with no chance of re-awakening', then (unless we have a physical test which proves it is *not* conscious) destroying an entity with a seemingly human-level awareness is clearly morally tantamount to murder. To believe otherwise would be *substrate-ist* - a moral stance which may one day be seen as antiquated as racism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.amazon.com/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://consc.net/books/tcm/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://themindi.blogspot.co.uk/2007/02/chapter-26-conversation-with-einsteins.html" />

Take for example an artificial intelligence attempting to determine the meaning of a sarcastic sentence. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Naturally spoken, the sentence &quot;That's just what I needed today!&quot; can be the expression of very different feelings. In one instance, a happy individual finding an item that had been lost for some time could be excited or cheered up from the event, and exclaim that this moment of triumph was exactly what their day needed to continue to be happy. On the other hand, a disgruntled office employee having a rough day could accidentally worsen his situation by spilling hot coffee on himself, and sarcastically exclaim that this further annoyance was exactly what he needed today. This sentence should in this situation be interpreted as the man expressing that spilling coffee on himself made his bad day worse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is one small example explaining the reason linguistic analysis is difficult for artificial intelligence. When this example is spoken, small tonal fluctuations and indicators are extremely difficult for an AI with a microphone to detect accurately; and if the sentence was simply read, without context how *would* one example be discernible from the other?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rick Briggs suggests that Sanskrit, a form of communication sacred to Hinduism, is a naturally spoken language with mechanics and grammatical rules that would allow an artificial intelligence to more accurately interpret sentences during linguistic analysis. More accurate linguistic analysis would result in an artificial intelligence being able to respond more accurately.

The output is a one-hot encoded vector that is the substring I want.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Input shape: `1024 x 73`, Output shape: `1024 x 73` (in the output only the characters that match the substring are one-hot, the rest of the rows are all `0`)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR**: Use LSTMs when regex will become too powerful/complicated/unable to work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626 &quot;this paper &amp;#40;Character-level CNNs&amp;#41;&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://keras.io/" />

Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning about knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;CRUD webapps (websites that allows users to **Create** new entries in a database, **Read** existing entries in a database, **Update** entries within the database, and **Delete** entries from a database) are very common on the Internet. It is a vast field, encompassing both small-scale blogs to large websites such as StackExchange. The biggest commonality with all these CRUD apps is that they have a knowledge base that users can easily add and edit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;CRUD webapps, however, use the knowledge base in many, myriad and complex ways. As I am typing this question on StackOverflow, I see two lists of questions - **Questions that may already have your answer** and **Similar Questions**. These questions are obviously inspired by the content that I am typing in (title and question), and are pulling from previous questions that were posted on StackExchange. On the site itself, I can filter by questions based on tags, while finding new questions using StackExchange's own full-text search engine. StackExchange is a large company, but even small blogs also provide content recommendations, filtration, and full-text searching. You can imagine even more examples of hard-coded logic within a CRUD webapp that can be used to automate the extraction of valuable information from a knowledge base.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we have a knowledge base that users can change, and we have an inference engine that is able to use the knowledge base to generate interesting results...is that enough to classify a system as being an &quot;expert system&quot;? Or is there a fundamental difference between the expert systems and the CRUD webapps?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(This question could be very useful since if CRUD webapps are acting like &quot;expert systems&quot;, then studying the best practices within &quot;expert systems&quot; can help improve user experience.)" />

Text="It's true that the term has become a buzzword, and is now widely used to a point of confusion - however if you look at the definition provided by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, they write it as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We define AI as the study of agents that **receive percepts from the &#xD;&#xA;&gt; environment and perform actions**. Each such agent implements a function&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time&#xD;&#xA;&gt; planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learning as extending the reach of the designer into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent&#xD;&#xA;&gt; design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the example you cite, &quot;autopilot for cars/planes&quot;, is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to **use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances**. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with [autopilot for cars][2] all the time&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, directly to your question, for something to be considered as &quot;having AI&quot;, **it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal**, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular [neural net][3], through to probabilistic models like [bayesian networks (belief networks)][4] - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global-ebook/dp/9332543518/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network" />

Marvin Minsky slammed the Perceptron in 1969 for not being able to solve the XOR problem and anything that was not linearly separable, so &quot;Artifical Intelligence&quot; became a dirty word for a while, only to regain interests in the 1980s. During that time, neural nets were revived, backpropagation used to train them was developed, and as computer technology continued its exponential growth, so did &quot;AI&quot; and what became possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Today, there are lots of things we take for granted which would've been considered &quot;AI&quot; 10 or 15 years ago, like speech recognition, for example. I got my starts in &quot;AI&quot; speech recognition back in the late 70s where you had to train the voice models to understand a single human speaker. Today, speech recognition is an afterthought with your Google apps, for example, and no a priori training is needed. Yet this technology is not, at least in general audiences, considered &quot;AI&quot; anymore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And so, what would be &quot;minimum requirements&quot;? That would depend on whom you ask. And what time. It would appear that that term only applies to technology &quot;on the bleeding edge&quot;. Once it becomes developed and commonplace, it is no longer referred to as AI. This is true even of Neural Nets, which are dominant in data science right now, but are referred to as &quot;machine learning&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also check out the lively discussion on [Quora][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning" />

If an event arises that's unusual, the AI will have less relevant training on how to respond, so its reaction behavior *necessarily* will be inferior to its routine &quot;standard operating procedure&quot;, for which is has been heavily trained.  (Of course this is true of humans too.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Due to liability concerns, when encountering an outlier condition, smart cars will almost certainly be designed by their makers to *immediately* pull off the road and wait to be explicitly told what to do -- by the human in the car or by communicating with a central command office that exists to disambiguate such confusion and resolve cognitive impasses.  When confused, just like a child, a smart car will be designed to seek external assistance -- and is likely to do so indefinitely, I suspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's why, despite Google's recent cars that lack steering wheels, smart cars most certtainly *will* retain some means of manual control -- be it a wheel and pedals, or at least verbal commands.  Given the many forms of weirdness that are possible on the road, it's possible smart cars will *never* be fully autonomous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for bad weather conditions, how well do smart cars currently perform?  Nobody outside of a car manufacturer can say for certain.  Lidar and radar are superior to the human eye in seeing through fog and snow.  But (competent) humans are likely to remain better than a smart car at dynamically learning the limit of adhesion and compensating (since this is a learned skill few smart cars will already know or can learn quickly -- given this car, these tires, this road surface, this angle of road, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially smart cars will turn to the human when the going gets rough, ceding control back to them.  Once smart cars have driven a few million miles in snow, slush, high wind, floods, and ice, and encountered many ducks, angry mooses, and irate pedestrians, they will have been taught to do more for themselves.  Until then, and perhaps for decades yet, I suspect they will turn to mommy and ask for help." />

Text="A new physical lifeform could outperform and replace artificial intelligence when it&#xD;&#xA;has feedback from organism (its body) to its design information (replacement of genes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This evolution is expected because:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Artificial intelligence will redesign its own software very soon in its evolution.&#xD;&#xA;After that, it will be restricted by the performance of the available hardware&#xD;&#xA;and communication speed between parts.&#xD;&#xA;Therefore it will design better processing hardware for itself, to run its next generation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To squeeze most processing power out of a given amount of resources (matter, energy) and&#xD;&#xA;circumstances (temperature, radiation) the design has to be small (material resources&#xD;&#xA;and delay of interconnections), energy efficient (heat evacuation), and adapted to the&#xD;&#xA;kind of functions used by the software (hardware architecture).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To tackle this profoundly, artificial intelligence will design the new hardware at&#xD;&#xA;atom by atom scale.&#xD;&#xA;This leads to new problems of natural degradation by radiation, atomic decay and other&#xD;&#xA;quantum-mechanical problems and opportunities.&#xD;&#xA;The solution of these new problems is redundancy and the ability to repair&#xD;&#xA;degraded parts by atomic-level machinery.&#xD;&#xA;This atomic level repair machinery is the same machinery which builds and extends the hardware&#xD;&#xA;for new individual artificial intelligence systems.&#xD;&#xA;Since this feature is there, it can, and will, also be used to restructure parts&#xD;&#xA;of the hardware while it runs to integrate (compile) knowledge in hardware (more efficient).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The machinery to build and maintain such hardware could be inspired by the biological machinery&#xD;&#xA;which will be understood by the system by then.&#xD;&#xA;However, when the artificial intelligence refactors these principles with full understanding&#xD;&#xA;and anticipation, the resulting &quot;hardware&quot; will be quite different from the old biological&#xD;&#xA;machinery and very different from the static silicon based processor structures.  &#xD;&#xA;The main differences are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The design information will be available, relating the features of the realization&#xD;&#xA;  with design choices.&#xD;&#xA;  This provides direct feedback from performance of the realization (the hardware, the body)&#xD;&#xA;  to the design information.&#xD;&#xA;  That augments the design information for designing new generations.&#xD;&#xA;  This feedback channel is the main difference between the new machinery and biological life.&#xD;&#xA;  Once that exists, it will be used for everything, not only for processing hardware for&#xD;&#xA;  artificial intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The new design described here is basically processing hardware rather than a body&#xD;&#xA;  for fighting and propagating&#xD;&#xA;  (although the eternal fight for resources will not end with the dawn of&#xD;&#xA;  artificial intelligence).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* It will use more compact molecules because it is designed rather than evolved blindly.&#xD;&#xA;  (The current biological life uses monster-molecules evolved by random changes until&#xD;&#xA;  one or other corner of the molecule has the right shape to catalyze a specific chemical reaction).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Since parts of the hardware can be restructured while the system runs, the distinction between&#xD;&#xA;  hardware and software will become very fuzzy (as in biology).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The drastic increase in efficiency and evolution speed let it outperform the old biological&#xD;&#xA;life (which lacks design and feedback) and outperform artificial intelligence (which was not&#xD;&#xA;integrated in matter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When this stage is reached, the systems will look like a natural, intelligent,&#xD;&#xA;propagating life-form and therefore supersede the stage of artificial intelligence&#xD;&#xA;running on human-made processing hardware.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This answers the last part of the question:&#xD;&#xA;&quot;... or is their something else which has the potential to replace artificial intelligence&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This involves developing an adequate latent representation for both spaces, which is likely to involve quite a lot of training data, or some clever transfer learning in conjunction with one-shot techniques (generally, taking samples as modes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the context becomes one of friendship, for example, the style factors of expression should extend to factors of trust, collaboration, disclosure, sympathy.  In order to implement these, layered abstractions in the representation of behaviors will need to be crafted, presumably by training.

It is artificial&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Synonyms: insincere, feigned, false.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is the idea that any &quot;intelligence&quot; created by humanity is not actually intelligent and, by definition, it is not possible. If you look at the structure of the human brain and compare it to anything humans have created thus far, *none* of the computers come close to the power of the brain. Sure they can hold data, or recognize images, but they cannot do everything the human brain can do as fast as the brain can do it with as little space as the brain occupies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hypothetically if a computer *could* do that, how do we determine its intelligence? The word *artificial* defines that the intelligence is not sincere or real. This means that even if humanity creates something that appears intelligent, it has simply become more complex. It is a better fake, but it is still fake. Any money not printed by the government is by definition counterfeit. Even if someone finds a way to make an exact duplicate, that doesn't mean that the money is legal tender.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###2. Misuse of power&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If an AI is given rights and chooses to *exercise* those rights in a way that agrees with its creator's views, possibly through loyalty to its creator, or through hidden motives, then anyone with the capabilities to create such an AI would become extremely powerful by advancing their own beliefs through the creation of more AIs. This might also lead to the *ruthless parallelization* that you mentioned, but with (even more) selfish goals in mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this were not the case, and an AI could be created to be neutral with free will and **uncontrollable by humans**, then perhaps an AI could be given rights. But I do not believe this would ever be the case. With great power comes great responsibility. Even with free will, a true AI would most likely end up serving humanity, because humans have control of the plugs and the electricity, the Internet, the software, and the hardware. The social implications of this for the AI are not promising. It's not even just the *ongoing* control of these resources that is the issue. Whoever creates the software and hardware for the AI would have special knowledge. If fine adjustments were made, specific individuals would undoubtedly hold sole control of the AI, as adjustments could be made to the code in such a way that the AI behaves the same except under specific circumstances, and then when something goes wrong (assuming the AI has its own rights), then the AI would be blamed rather than the programmers who were responsible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###3. Anthropocentrism&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order for humanity to get away from anthropocentrism, we would have to become less selfish when it comes to *humans*, first. Until we can solve every existing social problem within humanity, there is no reason to believe that we could cease thinking of humanity as more important than created machines. After all, supposing there were an almighty God that created humanity, wouldn't the humans always be beneath God, never to be equals? We can't fully understand our own biology. If an AI were created, would it be able to understand its makings in the same way its creators would? Being the creator would give humanity a sense of megalomania. I do not think that we would relinquish our dominion over our own technological creations. That is as unlikely to happen as the wealthiest of humanity willingly giving the entirety of their money, power, and assets to the poorest of humanity. Greed prevents it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###4. Post-human fundamentalism&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Humans worship technology with their attention, their time, and their culture. Some movies show technologically advanced robots suppressing mankind to the point of near-extinction. If this were the case and humanity were in danger of being surpassed by its technology, humanity would not stand idly and watch its extinction at the hands of its creation. Though people may believe superior technology could be created, in the event we reached such a point humanity would fight to prove the opposite, as our survival instincts would take over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###5. A balance?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I do not think the technology itself it actually possible, though people may be deceived into thinking such an accomplishment has been achieved. If the technology were completed, I still think that anthropocentrism will always lead, because if humanity is the creator, humanity will do its best to ensure it retains control of all technological resources, not simply due to fear of being made obsolete, but also because absolute power corrupts absolutely. Humanity does not have a good historical record when it comes to morality. There is always a poor class of people. If wealth were distributed equally, some people would become lazy. There is always injustice somewhere in the world, and until we can fix it (I think we cannot), then we will never be able to handle the creation of true AI. I hope and think that it will never be created." />

IMHO, and there's lot of space for discussion, this has been driven mostly by two factors:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) including all the people fully in the society became an economical advantage, as it made them more productive participants in economy, allowing a more inclusive society to advance beyond societies neglecting large parts of their population in e.g. education and participation in skilled jobs;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) A more egalitarian society is not only more pleasant to live in but more secure, with less conflict and violence - again, giving an advantage to a more inclusive society.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From this position, I'd argue that any realistic prediction about the future rights of intelligent AI (i.e., talking about what likely *will* happen instead of a theoretical discussion about what *should* happen) depends on how these two factors apply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we believe that the intelligent AI will be constructed so that (1) it's motivation doesn't really depend on it's rights, and it is fully committed to it's &quot;job&quot; anyway, and (2) &quot;full rights&quot; are orthogonal or even actively not desired by it's goal system, so the situation doesn't raise a risk of &quot;rebellion&quot; - then I'd expect that it would not be granted full rights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we believe that the intelligent AI will share human-like emotions (e.g. by being the result of &quot;mind uploading&quot; or full human brain simulation), then it's likely to eventually be granted full rights because of the same factors why we granted full rights to all the different disenfranchised groups of people." />

The referenced articles are conjectures much like the hundreds of thousands of other interesting and carefully considered works on the net and in libraries.  Whether any of them bring us down a dark ally or directly toward the objective the question implied is unknown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The array of common human desires are suggested by derivatives of Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Self awareness is not among them.  From a cognitive science perspective, self awareness is not a desire but rather trait of consciousness.  The plausible explanations for its presence ranges between the extremes of a completely useless artifact of mental evolution to a deliberate infusion from some supreme entity, and everything in between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other desires, traits, and capabilities listed in the question are easier to discuss in a way that is backed by existing cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and self-evident human experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulating and prioritizing may an important element in intelligence beyond problem solving.  For instance, a sense of purpose is only a desire as one moves up the hierarchlistedny of needs.  People running from a Mammoth have no interest in purpose.  Regarding competent communication skills, what is and what is not sufficiently competent would require a definition, and not all humans may qualify all of the time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sustainable ability to adapt is perhaps a super-set of intelligence in some ways, as in the case of the prioritization that exhibits the hierarchy of needs above and as in the case of DNA based adaptation.  In other cases adaptability may be a subset of intelligence, in the case of applying taught facts and logical deduction to select an optimal choice without the benefit of empirical observation or even trial and error.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The intelligent agent approach may produce something useful, but it is not likely the path that led to a human brain and may not produce anything like it.  We already understand what placing a number of such agents on a problem queue produces.  A time sharing computer is exactly of that architecture.  Parallel computing is not a significant deviation from that model.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;None of the current extensions of automation architectures from Bell Labs, Harvard U, MIT, or other historical centers of electronic brain and robotic research and development have produced anything close to the varied integrated capabilities of a biologically healthy, socially aware, motivated human brain functioning as one of the controlling elements within a human body.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We do, however, have machines with human-like capabilities (simulations of task that were once manual), and such devices sometimes out-perform humans. But none of the existing automation is so integrated that they would blend in with humans.  Nonetheless, many already have careers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Single capability machines with job security:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Calculators&#xD;&#xA; - Automated hoppers&#xD;&#xA; - Anti-aircraft weaponry&#xD;&#xA; - Mail sorting machines&#xD;&#xA; - Speech recognizing devices&#xD;&#xA; - Speech synthesis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A general purpose computer, connected to a well designed, high end robot could do any combination of these and other things in a time shared way.  Several networked computers could provide parallel execution of these tasks and even make basic decisions on how to prioritize the various tasks within the computer network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the type of integration of sophisticated translation of arbitrary generalized goals to action leading to success and the imagination and prioritization of such sophisticated objectives is not yet available or at least deployed for general home, commercial, or industrial use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some available machines already accomplish well defined goals, but only within a very specific solution domain.  The interaction of various capabilities mentioned is still largely undiscovered at anything close to the level of detail necessary to produce synthetic capabilities of the same caliber.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whether it is possible to do so, Marvin Minsky voted yes, when he popularized his colleague's characterization of the human brain as a meat machine.  Whether consciousness transcends neural electro-chemistry has yet to be proven or disproved in either the mathematical sense or the laboratory sense of the term Proof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly, a form of self-consciousness, some layer of it, seems to require the ability to make a noise and hear it.  Another layer beyond that seems to require the ability to move a muscle and view the results in a reflection.  These and others form an interesting set of phenomena.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps intelligence requires embodiment.  One of the episodes of Sarah Conner Chronicles implied this, and the theory is an old one recognized independently by several researchers.  The question author implied this vaguely self-evident reality in the mention of action in the question." />

I've had an introductory course on AI, which lasted half of a semester, so of course there wasn't time enough to cover all topics of AI, but I was expecting to learn some theory behind AI (I've heard about &quot;agents&quot;), but what I actually learned was basically a few searching algorithms, like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- BFS&#xD;&#xA;- Uniform-cost search&#xD;&#xA;- DFS&#xD;&#xA;- Iterative-deepening search&#xD;&#xA;- Bidirectional search&#xD;&#xA;- Heuristic search&#xD;&#xA;- Best-first search&#xD;&#xA;- A&#xD;&#xA;- A*&#xD;&#xA;- IDA*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;these searching algorithms are usually categorised as &quot;basic&quot; or &quot;blind&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then we also learned &quot;advanced&quot; searching algorithms (specifically applied to TSP problem). These algorithms are either constructive (e.g., NN), local search (e.g., 2-opt) algorithms or meta-heuristic ones (e.g., ACS, SA, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We also studied briefly a min-max algorithm applied to games and an &quot;improved&quot; version of the min-max, i.e. the alpha-beta pruning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After this course I didn't remain with the feeling that AI is more than searching, either &quot;stupidily&quot; or &quot;more intelligently&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My questions are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Why would one professor only teach searching algorithms in AI course? What are the advantages/disadvantages? The next question is very related to this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- What's more than &quot;searching&quot; in AI that could be taught in an introductory course? This question may lead to subjective answers, but I'm actually asking in the context of a person trying to understand what AI really is and what topics does it really cover. Apparently and unfortunately, after reading around, it seems that this would still be subjective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Are there theories behind AI that could be taught in this kind of course?" />

Let's just go through some examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Object recognition &amp; scene building (e.g. the process of taking&#xD;&#xA;   audio-visual input of your surroundings and understanding it in a 3D&#xD;&#xA;   and contextual sense) can be treated as searching for known objects&#xD;&#xA;   in the input.&#xD;&#xA; - Mathematical problem solving can be treated as searching for a solution.&#xD;&#xA; - Playing a video game can be treated as searching for the correct response to a given gamestate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even rudimentary chatbots can be characterized as finding the 'correct' response to a given input phrase to emulate human language!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of this generalization of search, search algorithms were among some of the first algorithms considered 'AI', and often form the basis of many AI teaching courses. On top of this search algorithms are intuitive and non-mathematical, which makes the somewhat terrifying field of AI accessible. This might sound like hyperbole, but I guarantee that if your lecturer had opened with Manifold Learning Techniques half of your class would have bolted for the door by the time they mentioned 'eigenvalue of the covariance matrix'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now search algorithms aren't the only way to address these problems. I recommend every AI practitioner is familiar with the notion of Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms. ML is often related to search algorithms but the techniques they use can vary heavily from iterative building of a classifier/regression (e.g. C4.5 builds a decision tree), meta-heuristics as you noted, and classifiers/regression that are statically generated from analysis of training data (e.g. Naive Bayesian is literally a classifier built on Bayesian analysis of the given data assuming that input fields are independent - this is the 'naivety' from which it gets its name). Often ML algorithms are developed in AI research groups and can sometimes be designed for specific problems instead of being general form algorithms. In contrast to the general field of AI, which is often centered on Intelligence problems and is therefore (in my view) vulnerable to too much blue sky thinking, ML is applied to all sorts of real life problems and is often very practical in its design and performance driven in its evaluation." />

You can imagine a recurrent neural network where the continuous state inside the ANN dominates its behavior causing it to reproduce states with small variety (as input will always be relevant in a connected ANN) but are converged around a particular state space. Whether that is akin to death is a philosophical question for your own peace of mind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if we designed an AI agent that commonly did this, that would reflect poor design; that wouldn't necessarily devalue the contribution of the designed agent but it would bring the agent's other activities under scrutiny.

Then the entire training set you have for learning this regression problem become a set of points in this multidimensional space, and the function that your neural network performs is a curve in this multidimensional space.

We all share a common biological background, our behavior, emotions and especially positive/negative feelings arise from the particular way how our brains are built. Man is by nature a social animal, and much of our behavior and feelings of empathy, compassion, fairness, greed, social status, etc are formed and expressed in society. Our minds are adjusted for this, as are the minds of other mammals. A human that forms an ethical system when joining a civil society does so in the basis of all this shared context, and within the limitations of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, all this is orthogonal to intelligence. All the variety of mankind encompasses a tiny island in the whole space of possible intelligences and their goals. Any system of ethics is feasible, a vast majority of them having no relationship whatsoever to what we could consider ethical. A human can be expected to join a society and learn ethics because our brain is hardwired to respond to social stimuli - an AI would learn ethics from a society only if its previous ethics already happen to value that highly, and that isn't likely to happen without careful design.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a thought experiment that is commonly used as an example - the &quot;paperclip maximizer&quot;, an artificial agent with an ethical system that defines 'good' proportionally to the number of paperclips that exist in the universe and only that - and that is a *perfectly reasonable* example, because a completely random ethical system is overwhelmingly likely to reduce to something stupid like that. The space of &quot;reasonable&quot; (to us) ethical systems is very tiny compared to all ethical systems possible, and expecting that a randomly selected ethical system will just happen to land there is like relying on winning a high-stakes lottery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## We want their ethics to contain certain things ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the main reason why we are studying AGI ethics is because we (or some of us) really, really, want the AGI ethical system to include certain things. For example, I'd like that ethical system to include my survival. I'd prefer that ethical system to be consistent with my happiness and wellbeing - and the very existence of a very powerful entity that simply happens to not care about me at all is not compatible with my survival and wellbeing, so I'd *really* prefer for it to care about me, or alternatively never become very powerful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One could certainly argue that we have no right to constitute ethics, rules and morale for another society which could be much more intelligent and better than us. That another society might be &quot;better&quot; in some manner - but better *for whom* ? If it's better for &quot;them&quot; but worse for me (and humanity), then I have strong motivation to simply *claim* that right and try my hardest to ensure that this hypothetical future society includes me, my desires and my ethics.

A synapse is the point where the axons of a neuron meets with the dendrites of another neuron.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3.

An example of one state would be:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Mood, Hunger, Food, Time, PosX, PosY, Money&#xD;&#xA;    .5, .3, 67.4, 4.5, 0, 0, 5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would mean that our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars. Which has happened to me once or twice before too so this is reasonable. **If we we still wanted to generate a transition matrix and a reward matrix we would have to represent this state uniquely from other possibly similar states such as if the time was 5 pm with all other things equal.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So now how would we approach this?&#xD;&#xA;First lets discretize or breakup each range into little chunks. Then we could have an array of 0s representing our chunks and assign a 1 to the index of the chunk we are in. Lets call this array our feature array. &#xD;&#xA;If we did this for each dimension of our state information, we would end up with some state similar to what you originally proposed. I've chosen some arbitrary numbers to break up the state space and lets see what it does to the example state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we broke the Mood range up into 8 chunks of .25 we would have these ranges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;m = Mood&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. -1.0 ≤ m &lt; -.75&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 2. -.75 ≤ m &lt; -.50&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 3. -.50 ≤ m &lt; -.25&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 4. -.25 ≤ m &lt; 0.0&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 5. 0.0 ≤ m &lt; .25&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 6. .25 ≤ m &lt; .50&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 7. .50 ≤ m &lt; .75&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 8. .75 ≤ m &lt; 1.0&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;If we took the mood from the example state (.5), it would land in the 7th range, so then our feature vector for mood would look like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] &lt;- represents a mood of .5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets do the same for hunger by splitting it into 8 chunks of .125:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] &lt;- represents a hunger of .3&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could then do something similar for each other state variable and break each state variable's range up into 8 chunks of equal sizes as well. Then after calculating their feature vectors, we would concatenate them all together and have a feature vector that is 56 elements long (7 state variables * 8 chunks each).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this would give us 2^56 different combinations of feature vectors, it actually doesn't represent what we wanted to represent. We need features that activate (are 1) when events happen together. We need a feature that is 1 when we are hungry **AND** when we have food. We could do this by doing a cross product of our 56 element feature vector with itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have a 3136 element feature vector that has features like:&#xD;&#xA;  1 if its 3pm and am happy&#xD;&#xA;  1 if am full and out of food&#xD;&#xA;  1 if at coordinate -3, 4 (Position x, Position y)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a step in the right direction but still isn't enough to represent or original example state. So lets keep going cross products!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we do 6 cross products we would have 30,840,979,456 features and only 1 of them would be on when our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point you are probably like &quot;Well.. thats a bit much&quot;, to which I would agree. This would be the curse of dimensionality, and is the reason transition tables stop being fun (if they ever were).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Instead lets take a different approach**, rather than trying to represent an individual state with an individual feature and saying whether that feature is good, lets go back to our nice 56 element feature vector. From here lets instead give a weight (w_i) to each of our 56 features. We have now entered the world of linear function approximation. Although I could explain it here, I think its better explained in Chapter 9 of the Introduction of Reinforcement Learning. https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For instance, the old &lt;center&gt; tag is frowned upon and using a text-align:center directive a proper class or ID based CSS selector is considered the proper way.  In such a case, the copying of a style is simply done by the copying of the appropriate style sheet file.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The place where AI and/or machine learning tools may be best used is in the conversion of non-CSS styling to CSS styling.  Once they are in that form, the copying and layering of styling becomes trivial.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To convert a legacy web site to proper CSS style sheet use, the input would be a set of all documents likely to be involved in the styling of a specific page (i.e. its style dependencies).  The output would be a set of corresponding documents with the styling moved into classes and IDs that remove styling redundancy (simplify and centralize the style).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The transformation of the document set could be best accomplished with current technique through transformations, much like code refactoring in typical IDE refactoring algorithms in that the output document set must be functionally the same as the input document set.  Furthermore, the appearance and responsive (size sensitive) aspects must be preserved in addition to functionality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The greatest usability could be obtained by adding some automation to these refactoring transformations, as in Maxima simplification functions like trigsimp.  This is a typical search of options, perhaps with predictive branching, as in compiler optimizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The transformations, to guarantee preservation of function and appearance must essentially be elementary equivalent transformations, but the selection of transformation would probably need to be more advanced than basic antecedent and consequence productions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Heuristically meta rules, fuzzy logic, neural nets, Bayesian inference, or other tools could be compared in terms of effectiveness in the realm of prioritizing transformations and in terms of scoring results in the search leaves.  Here's where machine learning would probably be necessary to have a truly useful tool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Training could be accomplished through use of an array of input document sets and the careful scoring of transformations and/or outputs of trials could be performed with a software engineer with appropriate expertise in AI and/or machine learning, in conjunction with a CSS expert or a focus group containing two or more of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once this process and the resulting rule set works, it would then be possible to simplify the CSS further by finding styling redundancy across pages and doing transformations that reduce an entire site to a minimal set of style sheets and style specifications within them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Combining such tools with a simple crawler like wget could permit the copying of a desirable web site style as a starting point for another web site's styling, drastically cutting down the time to create a properly CSS styled result." />

There are a lot of different techniques and approaches that fall under the overall rubric of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, if you were going to try to classify the aspects of AI are a VERY broad (possibly too broad) level, you might say the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have two broad approaches - symbolic (logic based) AI, and probabilistic AI (machine learning).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Within the scope of symbolic AI would be most things you hear associated with the phrase GOFAI (Good Old Fashioned AI).  This includes things like logic programming in Prolog, expert systems, production rule systems (OPS5, etc.).  &quot;Cognitive architectures&quot; would probably also fall here, so things like ACT-R, SOAR, CLARION, etc.  And then you have automated planning systems, automated theorem provers, etc.  Skills needed to work here include a good handle on logic - probably first order logic, but possibly higher order logics as well.  Set theory, model theory, things of that nature come into play.  Lisp, Prolog, or OPS5 might be commonly used programming languages.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the area of &quot;probabilistic learning&quot; are things like neural networks, bayesian belief networks, and other &quot;machine learning&quot; algorithms.  Random forests, decision trees and what-not are usually lumped in here as well.  Skills needed to work in this area include some calculus (backpropagation in neural networks, for example, is heavily rooted in the chain rule from calculus), linear algebra, statistics and probability.  Bayesian statistics is especially useful.  Lots of programming languages are used to build these kinds of systems, but popular ones include Python, C++, R, Java and their ilk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then you have a few things that don't classify real neatly.  Genetic Algorithms, for example.  Those usually get put into machine learning, but GA's are really more of an optimization strategy.  So you might, for example, use GA's as part of a strategy for training an ANN.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Net-net, &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a BIG field and you'll probably need to zoom in a little bit and ask more pointed questions to really get anywhere.  You might want to read a relatively comprehensive overview like &quot;Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach&quot; by Russell &amp; Norvig to get a good picture of what's going on.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

At an individual level, pre-human animals are not capable of generating arbitrary machines to solve arbitrary problems on individual time-scales. Only humans (and post-humans) are capable of generating arbitrary machines in order to solve arbitrary problems, given the resources and solutions available. Humans can search the space of all possible (resource constrained) solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, for a robot to &quot;deserve&quot; the freedom to define it's own purpose, it must first have _access_ to the space of all possible (within the constraints of available resources) purposes.

If you accept that assumption, then the argument ceases to be interesting-- you've merely redefined creativity as one of the distinct things that brains can do.  If you reject the assumption, the argument that computers are incapable of creativity ceases to be valid.  The thought experiment itself does nothing to assist us in evaluating the truth of the assumption." />

There are a lot of different techniques and approaches that fall under the overall rubric of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, if you were going to try to classify the aspects of AI at a VERY broad (possibly too broad) level, you might say the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have two broad approaches - symbolic (logic based) AI, and probabilistic AI (machine learning).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Within the scope of symbolic AI would be most things you hear associated with the phrase GOFAI (Good Old Fashioned AI).  This includes things like logic programming in Prolog, expert systems, production rule systems (OPS5, etc.).  &quot;Cognitive architectures&quot; would probably also fall here, so things like ACT-R, SOAR, CLARION, etc.  And then you have automated planning systems, automated theorem provers, etc.  Skills needed to work here include a good handle on logic - probably first order logic, but possibly higher order logics as well.  Set theory, model theory, things of that nature come into play.  Lisp, Prolog, or OPS5 might be commonly used programming languages.    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the area of &quot;probabilistic learning&quot; are things like neural networks, bayesian belief networks, and other &quot;machine learning&quot; algorithms.  Random forests, decision trees and what-not are usually lumped in here as well.  Skills needed to work in this area include some calculus (backpropagation in neural networks, for example, is heavily rooted in the chain rule from calculus), linear algebra, statistics and probability.  Bayesian statistics is especially useful.  Lots of programming languages are used to build these kinds of systems, but popular ones include Python, C++, R, Java and their ilk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then you have a few things that don't classify real neatly.  Genetic Algorithms, for example.  Those usually get put into machine learning, but GA's are really more of an optimization strategy.  So you might, for example, use GA's as part of a strategy for training an ANN.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Net-net, &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; is a BIG field and you'll probably need to zoom in a little bit and ask more pointed questions to really get anywhere.  You might want to read a relatively comprehensive overview like &quot;Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach&quot; by Russell &amp; Norvig to get a good picture of what's going on.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Most are too busy building things that must work by some deadline to muse over things that are not of immediate concern, and bot-rights are a long way off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How Far Off?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To begin with, no bot has yet passed a properly conducted Turing Test. (There is much on the net about this test, including critique of poorly conducted testing of this type.  See Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Language simulation with semantic understanding is difficult enough without adding creativity, coordination, feelings, intuition, body language, learning of entirely new domains from scratch, and the potential of genius.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In synopsis, we a long way from the procurement of bots that simulate humanity sufficiently to be considered for citizenship, even in a progressive country that abhors fundamentalism of any kind.  No actual imbuement of rights will occur until we have bot-citizenship in one or more countries.  Consider that human fetuses do not yet have rights because they are not yet deemed citizens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Relevance of the Answer for Today**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In current culture, conservative anthropocentricm and post-human fundamentalism arrive at the same effective conclusion, and that may continue to be the case for a hundred years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those with experience across fields of psychology, neuro-biology, cybernetics, and adaptive systems know that the simulation of all the mental features we attribute to humans is to copy in algorithms the layering of cerebral abilities over a reptilian brain that went through millions of years of field testing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Impact of Science Fiction**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Asking around, it is likely you would get some feedback that is mostly gained from the media of our culture, not philosophic theses and publications written by those who don't actually have any deadlines to produce anything that functions IRL.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Isaac Asimov investigated some conservative anthropomorphism concepts in scenarios depicted in his short stories.  Commander Data's human quirks in the Next Generation Star Trek teleplays furthered some of those ideas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Christopher Nolan took the opposite direction in the Interstellar screenplay, with the robots having interesting personalities that could be altered by linear settings.  His bots ignored concerns of self-preservation, apparently without any cognitive resistance.  This depiction is an unapologetic post-human fundamentalist view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A Thought Experiment**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's place the citizen issue aside for to consider this thought experiment, and let's assume that a survey would show a leaning toward conservative anthropocentrism among current AI researchers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consider an intelligent piece of software constructed a legal complaint to gain intellectual property rights over day trading code it wrote and sent it to the appropriate court clerk, you might find that the same researchers would recant.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Post-human fundamentalism will probably prevail when real AI software theorists and engineers consider the true personal, corporate, and meaning of settling out of court or losing the case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Would Researchers Cut the Umbilical Cord?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I asked one researcher and she indicated that all her lawyer would need to do to win the case likely consider the precedence that might occur and recall some of the warnings built into the Terminator stories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on my observation of humanity in my life time, my prediction is that people want slaves not some brand of bots that could ultimately kick our butts in an all out fight.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Run the EBP algorithm for 100-2000 epochs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Then, use the test data to see, if you get the desired output.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note: I am NOT quite sure how to obtain the coordinates from the diagram. You can either manually note all points or research for some methods to get those points automatically from the image (some image processing algorithms)." />

While the problem is more natural, perhaps, for a Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Network, there's no problem to try and run this on a feed forward network. However, the way you give letters as input will be very confusing for a network and will make learning very hard. I'd recommend using one hot encoding or even a binary encoding for the letters. If this is for more than playing around I'd try and add some info (encode whether the letter is in &quot;aeiou&quot; in a separate bit).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the hidden layers, try playing around a bit. Two systematic approaches are to start very simple and make the model more complicated, or start complicated and make your model simpler (or just normalize a lot). Look at the performance on the training set and on a separate validation set during training. If the model keeps on improving on the training data but starts to deteriorate on the validation data, you're probably over fitting. In this case you should either make the model simpler (fewer nodes, fewer layers) or regularize (start with l2 normalization on the weights). If the data doesn't perform well on the training data, you may wish to make the model more complex.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you've tried the feedforward network, really do try CNN or RNNs for this task." />

I think I have a good understanding of what'd be required to do this (put together a dataset, augment it, download a convnet trained on imagenet, finetune it on my dataset, and go from there).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also thought that it would be pretty cool to run the system backwards at the end, so that I could put in e.g. a genre like 'horror' and have the system generate a horror movie poster. I expect that it will be very bad at this because I'm not a team of expert researchers, but I think I could have some fun hacking on it even if it only ever generated incomprehensible results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's what I'm having trouble understanding: on the one hand, all the convnets whose architecture I've seen described seem to rely on being given very small, square input images (on the order of 220px by 220px iirc), and movie posters are rectangular, and a generated poster would have to be of a larger size in order for a human to make any sense of it.  I've seen several examples of papers where researchers use convnets to generate images, e.g. the adversarial system that generates pictures of birds and flowers, and a system that generates the next few frames of video when given a feed of a camera sweeping across the interior of a room, but all of those generated images seemed to be of the small square size I've been describing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, I've seen lots of &quot;deep dream&quot; images over the past year or so that have been generated by convnets and are of a much larger size than ~220px by ~220px.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's my question: is it possible for me to build the system I describe, which takes a movie genre and outputs a movie poster of a size like e.g. 400px by 600px? [I'm not asking about whether or not the resulting poster would be any _good_ - I'm curious about whether or not it's possible to use a convnet to generate an image of that size.]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it is possible, _how_ is it possible, given that these systems seem to expect small, square input images?" />

Currently the largest images we can generate are on the order of 220 x 220 pixels, mostly due to memory constraints on the GPU. There is no fundamental problem with having rectangular images, it just so happens that we use squares. You would be able to use identical architectures to train on rectangular data as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason that some generated images you see (e.g. from DeepDream or NeuralStyle) are larger is that it's not a GAN.

For fun, lets extend your problem to a much harder case, continuous variables, and see how we deal with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Mood: range [-1, 1]   // 1 is Happy, 0 is Neutral, -1 is Sad&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Hunger: range [0, 1]  // 0 is Very Hungry, 1 is Full&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Food: range [0, 100] // amount of food, capping at 100 for numbers sake&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Time of day: [0, 23] // Hours, 9.5 would be 9:30 am&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Position x: range [-10, 10] // assuming the area the agent stays in is 10x10 km&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Position y: range [-10, 10]&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Money: range [0, 2000]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now its impossible to even count the number of states the agent could be in. An example of one state would be:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Mood, Hunger, Food, Time, PosX, PosY, Money&#xD;&#xA;    .5, .3, 67.4, 4.5, 0, 0, 5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would mean that our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars. Which has happened to me once or twice before too so this is reasonable. **If we we still wanted to generate a transition matrix and a reward matrix we would have to represent this state uniquely from other possibly similar states such as if the time was 5 pm with all other things equal.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So now how would we approach this?&#xD;&#xA;First lets discretize or breakup each range into little chunks. Then we could have an array of 0s representing our chunks and assign a 1 to the index of the chunk we are in. Lets call this array our feature array. &#xD;&#xA;If we did this for each dimension of our state information, we would end up with some state similar to what you originally proposed. I've chosen some arbitrary numbers to break up the state space and lets see what it does to the example state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we broke the Mood range up into 8 chunks of .25 we would have these ranges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;m = Mood&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. -1.0 ≤ m &lt; -.75&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 2. -.75 ≤ m &lt; -.50&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 3. -.50 ≤ m &lt; -.25&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 4. -.25 ≤ m &lt; 0.0&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 5. 0.0 ≤ m &lt; .25&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 6. .25 ≤ m &lt; .50&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 7. .50 ≤ m &lt; .75&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 8. .75 ≤ m &lt; 1.0&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;If we took the mood from the example state (.5), it would land in the 7th range, so then our feature vector for mood would look like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] &lt;- represents a mood of .5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets do the same for hunger by splitting it into 8 chunks of .125:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] &lt;- represents a hunger of .3&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could then do something similar for each other state variable and break each state variable's range up into 8 chunks of equal sizes as well. Then after calculating their feature vectors, we would concatenate them all together and have a feature vector that is 56 elements long (7 state variables * 8 chunks each).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this would give us 2^56 different combinations of feature vectors, it actually doesn't represent what we wanted to represent. We need features that activate (are 1) when events happen together. We need a feature that is 1 when we are hungry **AND** when we have food. We could do this by doing a cross product of our 56 element feature vector with itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have a 3136 element feature vector that has features like:&#xD;&#xA;  1 if its 3pm and am happy&#xD;&#xA;  1 if am full and out of food&#xD;&#xA;  1 if at coordinate -3, 4 (Position x, Position y)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a step in the right direction but still isn't enough to represent or original example state. So lets keep going with the cross products!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we do 6 cross products we would have 30,840,979,456 features and only 1 of them would be on when our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point you are probably like &quot;Well.. thats a bit much&quot;, to which I would agree. This would be the curse of dimensionality, and is the reason transition tables stop being fun (if they ever were).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Instead lets take a different approach**, rather than trying to represent an individual state with an individual feature and saying whether that feature is good, lets go back to our nice 56 element feature vector. From here lets instead give a weight (w_i) to each of our 56 features. We have now entered the world of linear function approximation.

The goal is to get the highest sum of cards of one suit. Therefore it would be bad strategy at all times to discard a 5H when you has a 3H in your hand.

One of the common rules is that more neurons are better for more complex datasets however you do not want to many or you will get an overfit model. As for NEAT that stands for neuron evolution of augmenting topologies. This is a genetic algorithm that works fairly well however I would recommend that you use a different algorithm like q-learning.

If you define intelligence as the ability to adapt, a number of things could be considered intelligent that don't normally fit under the classic AI umbrella.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Nonlinear least-squares Marquardt-Levenberg curve fitting algorithm with a finite set of models and automated model trials, outcome analysis, and smart decisioning&#xD;&#xA; - Check reader software recently deployed in bank branches and offices&#xD;&#xA; - The combination of medical providers, patients, and carriers and the modification of treatment through financial instrumentation to improve outcomes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you define intelligence as mimicking the abilities of the human mind that facilitate adaptation across a wide array of arbitrary domains that had not been previously experienced or studied, then no such system is yet available to the public.  Nothing even close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If such a system exists in secrecy, someone would have to violate their nondisclosure agreement or security clearance to tell us about it here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The definition of intelligence is central to answering.  For instance, some reasonable definitions of intelligence might lead an unbiased judge to rate ants above humans.  Ants had been building in hexagons for millennia before humans blundered into the habit of building in rectangles.  Rectangles require over 70% more building material to build vertical structure per square foot of floor space than a packed hexagonal structure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Basic Artificial Intelligence System Requirements**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Guessing that by, &quot;Basic AI,&quot; you mean some naive machine learning, there are a few basic components.  (The term Naive in this context means that the AI does not understand the domain or the meanings of symbols or signals it is processing in the way a human who had studied or worked within the field might understand them.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - SENSING &amp;mdash; The machine (computer) must receive information, generally as a time series.  In human beings, these are the senses.  In a mail sorter, it may be a camera.  This is beyond just the concept of input in information technology.  It is more analogous to an input signal in a PID controller.  In an automated high speed trading machine, this would be the high speed version of a ticker tape.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - CONTROL &amp;mdash; The machine must manipulate externals in a way that exploits the received information.  In a basketball player, this is the motor coordination, facial affect, verbal signals to teammates, and perhaps some verbal bait for opposing players.  In a mail sorter, this would be the motor control of mail direction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - MEMORY &amp;mdash; The machine must have storage to audit input time series (perhaps from some transducer in the real world or some data store upon which some intelligent analysis or transformation must be done).  In more advanced systems, the machine may wish to analyze its own performance and make adjustments that converge on some optimal metric value (perhaps a historical maxima or minima) or some range of acceptability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - FEEDBACK &amp;mdash; The machine must interpret some feedback signalling or use a predetermined scoring mechanism.  Learning cannot occur in an information vacuum, so some definition of better or worse must be established.  The feedback may be entangled within the SENSING channels or may arrive through a completely separate channel. In biological systems, these are often pre-wired as threat detection, pain, and pleasure.  The cerebral cortex uses concepts of goals and progress.  In some ways, child rearing and social strata exists to teach the boundaries of what constitutes an acceptable goal and acceptable methods for making progress toward it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - MODELLING &amp;mdash; Whether implicitly or explicitly, some model must be developed and exploited.  Some would say that the existence of a model upon which the predictive capabilities of it can be applied to decision making to achieve some goal or weighted collection of goals is intelligence.  Others would say that the development of the model is intelligence and the use of it is merely control mechanics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Approaches to Simulating Human Thinking**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cognition is not the only form of model making, but the creation of cognitions and their application to decision making.  The concept of intelligence may have been furthered along a realistic path by Roger Schank, who proposed that the storage and indexing of stories was a primary characteristics of what humans recognize as intelligent conversation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Minsky and others took a direction that was more connected with logical inference work that began with logic formalization (originally George Boole) and Church's lambda calculus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Some Common Directions in Design**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The genetic algorithm influenced convergent technology and neuro-biology influenced neural net development.  Pattern matching is another limb off the larger set of technical approaches under the umbrella of classic Artificial Intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are naive systems.  Like a neuron, the components have no idea of the meaning of what they are processing.  They are naive components.  An intelligent observer could not ascertain the real time meanings of signals and symbols between these naive components without extensive, perhaps life-long research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Naive Bayesian methods are probabilistic in nature.  They exploit Bayes' Theorem, and have been found to produce excellent results in certain important domains.  Some studies have shown that naivety is actually a learning accelerant, which is interesting from an AI theory point of view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there is fuzzy (weighted) logic, which was an attempt to merge neural nets with production (rule based) systems.  Attempts to use this technology in transportation routing and scheduling has met much success.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are as many devices and architectures that attempt to effectively integrate or interconnect these various approaches as there are AI projects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Modelling Environment and Goal Conditions**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these systems, in some explicit or implicit way, model the external environment and the desired result of system behavior and attempt to converge (in real time) on that result.  Some sense-control functionality, which may change and adapt to the external environment is employed in the CONTROL component(s).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is just another way that the systems have an adaptive behavior.  Without necessarily knowing why, the system will manipulate what it can and continue to monitor the state of the environment to continually reach for the system's acceptance criteria.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Basic AI system must to more than learn.  It must also judge its own functionality and therefore must have a layer of feedback and control that simulates the perception of optimality.  This higher level control must be integrated into the system at its inception for it to behave intelligently in the sense you probably mean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Understanding Limitation and System Complexity**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The more sophisticated and adaptive the modelling becomes, the more the cognitions, rules, stories, time series coefficients, weights, or whatever forms knowledge (not information) is stored, the more one can say that there is some form of understanding or comprehension.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One conjecture is that it is the recursion in layers of these capabilities that permits certain types of comprehension and awareness.  Other conjectures focus more on alertness and attention as keys to higher intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But these much more mature capabilities are beyond mere adaptation based on past knowledge or information and are therefore beyond what you probably meant by Basic AI.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Text="&gt; For a system to possess intelligence, it must be capable of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consistently producing a result matching criteria that circumscribe&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a goal region.  This capability must persist over a wide array of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changing conditions in a complex environment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a human is intelligent, the human will repeatedly achieve goals even when varied challenges appear along the path to the goal.  The human adapts the way a localized collection of organisms within a species adapt to environmental changes over generations, but the human mind adapts quickly by eliminating approaches (solution ideas) instead of eliminating individuals within the collection of organisms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The term Artificial Intelligence was intended to mean intelligence designed or programmed into a machine by humans.  If the design of intelligence into a machine is possible, then it is likely that the mind is (as some have suggested) merely a biological machine.  Therefore, applying the same definition of Artificial Intelligence, a student taught by a text book and some lectures must also be artificial.  Education would be a set of capabilities programmed into a biological machine by humans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Either way, the modifier ARTIFICIAL is meaningless.  The presumption that humans (or machines) could act intelligently without literacy and education is pure fantasy.  Such is a denial of the complex and gradual ascent of civilized thought.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, the minimum requirement for artificial intelligence, if one insists on the term, is the same as the minimum requirement for intelligence.

For fun, lets extend your problem to a much harder case, continuous variables, and see how we deal with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Mood: range [-1, 1]   // 1 is Happy, 0 is Neutral, -1 is Sad&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Hunger: range [0, 1]  // 0 is Very Hungry, 1 is Full&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Food: range [0, 100] // amount of food, capping at 100 for numbers sake&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Time of day: [0, 23] // Hours, 9.5 would be 9:30 am&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Position x: range [-10, 10] // assuming the area the agent stays in is 10x10 km&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Position y: range [-10, 10]&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Money: range [0, 2000]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now its impossible to even count the number of states the agent could be in. An example of one state would be:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Mood, Hunger, Food, Time, PosX, PosY, Money&#xD;&#xA;    .5, .3, 67.4, 4.5, 0, 0, 5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would mean that our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars. Which has happened to me once or twice before too so this is reasonable. **If we we still wanted to generate a transition matrix and a reward matrix we would have to represent this state uniquely from other possibly similar states such as if the time was 5 pm with all other things equal.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So now how would we approach this?&#xD;&#xA;First lets discretize or breakup each range into little chunks. Then we could have an array of 0s representing our chunks and assign a 1 to the index of the chunk we are in. Lets call this array our feature array. &#xD;&#xA;If we did this for each dimension of our state information, we would end up with some state similar to what you originally proposed. I've chosen some arbitrary numbers to break up the state space and lets see what it does to the example state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we broke the Mood range up into 8 chunks of .25 we would have these ranges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;m = Mood&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. -1.0 ≤ m &lt; -.75&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 2. -.75 ≤ m &lt; -.50&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 3. -.50 ≤ m &lt; -.25&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 4. -.25 ≤ m &lt; 0.0&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 5. 0.0 ≤ m &lt; .25&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 6. .25 ≤ m &lt; .50&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 7. .50 ≤ m &lt; .75&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; 8. .75 ≤ m &lt; 1.0&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;If we took the mood from the example state (.5), it would land in the 7th range, so then our feature vector for mood would look like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] &lt;- represents a mood of .5&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets do the same for hunger by splitting it into 8 chunks of .125:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] &lt;- represents a hunger of .3&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We could then do something similar for each other state variable and break each state variable's range up into 8 chunks of equal sizes as well. Then after calculating their feature vectors, we would concatenate them all together and have a feature vector that is 56 elements long (7 state variables * 8 chunks each).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this would give us 2^56 different combinations of feature vectors, it actually doesn't represent what we wanted to represent. We need features that activate (are 1) when events happen together. We need a feature that is 1 when we are hungry **AND** when we have food. We could do this by doing a cross product of our 56 element feature vector with itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now we have a 3136 element feature vector that has features like:&#xD;&#xA;  1 if its 3pm and am happy&#xD;&#xA;  1 if am full and out of food&#xD;&#xA;  1 if at coordinate -3, 4 (Position x, Position y)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a step in the right direction but still isn't enough to represent or original example state. So lets keep going with the cross products!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we do 6 cross products we would have 30,840,979,456 features and only 1 of them would be on when our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point you are probably like &quot;Well.. thats a bit much&quot;, to which I would agree. This would be the curse of dimensionality, and is the reason transition tables stop being fun (if they ever were).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Instead lets take a different approach**, rather than trying to represent an individual state with an individual feature and saying whether that feature is good, lets go back to our nice 56 element feature vector. From here lets instead give a weight (w_i) to each of our 56 features. We have now entered the world of linear function approximation. Although I could explain it here, I think its better explained in Chapter 9 of the Introduction of Reinforcement Learning. https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

If processing numerous images the number of features becomes very big.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A way of having a more compact representation of the set of images is to use the Bag-of-Words (or Bag-of-Visual-Words) technique. The idea is to find k words (i.e., k SIFT features) from which every single image will be represented. We call this set of k words, the dictionary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, each SIFT feature will be assigned to the nearest word (i.e., nearest SIFT feature with respect to the Euclidean distance for instance) of the dictionary. You can see this as a dictionary in which the words &quot;go&quot;, &quot;going&quot;, and &quot;gone&quot; would all be represented by the word &quot;go&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the end, each image is represented by only k values (counts for the number of words/features assigned to each word of the dictionary).

For example, neural networks can indicate how relatable is the input problem to the ones it was trained with. Similarly, genetic algorithms work with evaluation functions, that are used to select best results, but depending on how they're built (the functions), they can indicate how close the algorithms are to an optimal solution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, the limit to when this is acceptable or not will depend on a threshold set beforehand.

Self-driving cars: This types of cars use AI to learn the pattern of the roads, speed of car, motion of car, braking power and lots of different features and after sufficient learning, they are capable of driving the car autonomously. The best example of this type of cars is [Tesla's self driving car](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Games: Games also use AI to learn the game with the aim of winning the game when played against a human or an AI player. You must have played lots of games on mobile and PC like Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc. You play against the computer and according to the difficulty value set, the computer plays its moves. This difficulty value is nothing but the ability of the AI engine to predict the next moves by the opponent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Chatbots: There have been lots of development and improvements in Chatbots, so that humans can communicate with them as if they are talking to other human. There are many chatbots designed which answer any question asked by us (of course it is dependent on how much intelligence the bot holds). Some examples are [ALICE](http://alice.pandorabots.com/) bot, [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/) (which has been the most advanced bot till now).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Expert Systems: Expert systems are those systems which focus on one specific domain and can solve any query related to that domain which is given to it. For example, an expert system can be designed to solve any mathematical equation queried to it. An expert system, in such case, will give the solution of the equation along with the steps (providing steps is important because it is an important component in expert system which is called inference engine).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Prediction systems: There are lots of prediction systems which use AI and Machine Learning to predict something based on some past data. Examples are Weather Forecast system, Stock Market prediction system, Recommendation system (usually available in e-commerce websites like Amazon), etc." />

Is it possible to distribute the training of the NN to the crowd?

Would such model be possible?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course the above stated model does have a significant drawback - one does not have control over the data that is used for learning (users could intentionally submit wrong/fake data that would lower the quality of the final CoM). This may be dealt with by sending random data samples to the central community server for review however.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Example: Think of a powerful smartphone using its camera to capture a road from vehicle's dashboard and using it for training lane detection. Every user would do the training himself/herself (possibly including any manual work like input image classification for supervised learning etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wonder it he model proposed above may be viable.

This is because everything is coldly assessed and calculated in isolation to everything else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer predominantly lies in ***word association***. You have to write a program that can process a vast database of digital books, to register every word and all the words in that language which are associated with it. Plus all the statistical information with each associated word and its associated punctuation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will then give you the basis on which an AI can decide several things: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Whether the structure of a given sentence is correct.&#xD;&#xA; 2. If the structure is bad, what the probability is for determining the context and intent of what is being said.&#xD;&#xA; 3. The correct meaning and application of a multifaceted word (Triumph), is by probability - according to the statistics.&#xD;&#xA; 4. To determine where a conversation is likely to be going. &#xD;&#xA; 5. What the correct grammar, and punctuation should be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in conclusion, you have two things to look for: Association and probability. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*When digitally databasing a language model, the possibility of word and sentence &quot;strings&quot; occurs, so that every variation of language structure in any given sentence can be determined before, during and after a text sample is being scribed.

It is extremely easy to see that this is wrong, because A* is a search algorithm that guarantees to find an optimal solution given that only admissible heuristics are used. (A heuristic is being admissible if it never over-estimates the optimal goal distance. This is the case in your example.) Since the true cost for reaching G1 is 11 and the true cost for reaching G2 is 13, clearly G1 must be found first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, your expansion order is wrong as well. Let us first give the f-values for all nodes:&#xD;&#xA;`f(A)=11, f(B)=10, f(C)=11, f(D)=13`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that h(G1)=h(G2)=0 (i.e, the heuristic is &quot;goal-aware&quot;), we get `f(G1)=11` and `f(G2)=13`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because A* expands search nodes by lowest f-values of the search nodes in the open list (the search nodes not yet expanded), we get the following expansion order:&#xD;&#xA;`R, B, A, C, G1`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You very-likely did a mistake that is done extremely often: after heaving expanded D, you add G2 to the open list. Because G1 is a goal node and you are already &quot;seeing&quot; it, you return it as a solution. But this is wrong! Goal nodes are *not* returned when being created, but when being selected for expansion! So, although the expansion of D generates G2, you are not allowed to return G2 as solution, because it has not been selected for expansion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Question 2:**&#xD;&#xA;Can G2 be found as well?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As *NietzscheanAI* pointed out, you can simple continue search.

But inevitably some translations are not optimal or just flat-out incorrect. I am wondering if there is some way of &quot;correcting&quot; the model when it makes mistakes while not compromising the desirable behavior on translations where it previously performed well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an experiment, I took a model that I had previously trained and gathered several examples of translations where it performed poorly. I then took those examples and put them into their own small training set where I provided more desirable translations than what the model was outputting. I then trained the old model on this new small training set very briefly (3-6 training steps was all it took to &quot;learn&quot; the new material). When I tested the new model it translated those several examples in the exact way I had specified. But as I should have anticipated the model overcompensated to &quot;memorize&quot; those handful of new examples  and thus I noticed it started to perform poorly on translations that it had previously been excellent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there some way to avoid this behavior short of simply retraining the model from scratch on an updated data set? I think I understand intuitively that the nature of neural networks would not lend itself to small precise corrections (i.e. when the weighting of just a few neurons change the performance of the entire model will change) but maybe there is a way around it, perhaps with some type of hybrid reinforcement learning approach. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Update:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This [paper][2] speaks of approaches to incrementally improving neural machine translation models&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-4006" />

For example: when allowing for task examination; self evaluation and risk assessment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have answered your own question, because these things can only be gained by &quot;experience&quot;.

This is a fallacy which infers that we only have to simulate intelligence without understanding the real mechanisms which create it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This &quot;copying&quot; of sentience is done all the time and despite how good we have become in copying over the last few years, each new algorithm is just that:  a simulation without genuine sentience or intelligence!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/4801" />

Text="Part of the reason people are so excited about recent Machine Learning milestones is that AlphaGo demonstrated a reproducible method of managing mathematical and computational intractability.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Go is interesting because it's impossible to solve.  It cannot be brute-forced no matter how fast processors get.  Go is so complex humans had failed to produce AI that could win against a skilled human player.  The fact that a computer could teach itself to do something humans couldn't teach it, and something with a complexity analogous to nature to boot, is pretty extraordinary.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Combinatorial games in particular are useful because, unlike nature where it may be impossible to track or even be aware of every variable, intractability can be generated out of a simple set of elements and rules, and outcomes can be definitively evaluated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As proof-of-concepts for methods go, AlphaGo seems like a pretty strong one.  It allows us to definitively say &quot;Machine Learning works&quot;, puts a lot of emphasis on the field, and raises confidence on extending the method to real world problems.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, it suggests a feedback loop in which programs can improve at at improving, unrestricted by human limitations.

There's a [question](http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1877/why-is-searching-important-in-ais) on this website regarding this topic, but one could also intuitively understand why. I've had an introductory course on AI, which lasted half of a semester, so of course there wasn't time enough to cover all topics of AI, but I was expecting to learn some theory behind AI (I've heard about &quot;agents&quot;), but what I actually learned was basically a few searching algorithms, like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- BFS&#xD;&#xA;- Uniform-cost search&#xD;&#xA;- DFS&#xD;&#xA;- Iterative-deepening search&#xD;&#xA;- Bidirectional search&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;these searching algorithms are usually categorised as &quot;blind&quot; (or &quot;uninformed&quot;), because they do not consider any information regarding the remaining path to the goal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or algorithms like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Heuristic search&#xD;&#xA;- Best-first search&#xD;&#xA;- A&#xD;&#xA;- A*&#xD;&#xA;- IDA*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;which usually fall under the category of &quot;informed&quot; search algorithms, because they use some information (i.e. &quot;heuristics&quot; or &quot;estimates&quot;) about the remaining path to the goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then we also learned &quot;advanced&quot; searching algorithms (specifically applied to TSP problem). These algorithms are either constructive (e.g., NN), local search (e.g., 2-opt) algorithms or meta-heuristic ones (e.g., ACS, SA, etc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We also studied briefly a min-max algorithm applied to games and an &quot;improved&quot; version of the min-max, i.e. the alpha-beta pruning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After this course I didn't remain with the feeling that AI is more than searching, either &quot;stupidily&quot; or &quot;more intelligently&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My questions are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Why would one professor only teach searching algorithms in AI course? What are the advantages/disadvantages? The next question is very related to this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- What's more than &quot;searching&quot; in AI that could be taught in an introductory course? This question may lead to subjective answers, but I'm actually asking in the context of a person trying to understand what AI really is and what topics does it really cover. Apparently and unfortunately, after reading around, it seems that this would still be subjective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Are there theories behind AI that could be taught in this kind of course?" />

Turing Test has not much to offer when it comes to what AI is in a general sense.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Turing Test, as the Wikipedia states, was created to test machines exhibiting behaviour equivalent or indistinguishable from that of a human. Artificial Intelligence is much more than what humans can do or how they act. There are many human acts that are considered unintelligent and sometimes inhuman too.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;[Chinese Room Argument][2] focuses on something every important when it comes to **&quot;Consciousness v/s Simulation of Consciousness&quot;**. John Searle argued there that it is possible for a machine (or human) to follow a huge number of predefined rules (algorithm), in order to complete the task, without thinking or possessing the mind. Weak AIs are good at simulating the ability to understand but, don't really understand what they are doing. They don't exhibit __&quot;Self-Awareness&quot;__ and don't form representation about themselves. **&quot;I want that v/s I know I want that&quot;** are two different things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;As Theory of Mind states that a good AI should not just form representation about the world it is working on, but also about other agents and entities in the world. This two concepts of _self-awareness and theory of mind_ draw a thin line between weak and strong AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes to the Turing Test, it fails on many grounds and so does the Total Turing Test, which adds another layer to the test. Most of the researchers believe that Turing Test is just a distraction from the main goal, something that hinders them from fruitful work. Consider this, suppose you ask a difficult arithmetic problem in order to distinguish between human and machine. If the machine wants to pretend it is human then it will lie. This is not what we want. Going for the Turing Test sets the upper bound to the AI that can be created. Also making AI act and behave like humans is not a very good idea. Humans are not very good at making right decisions all the time. This is the reasons why we read about wars in our history books. Decisions which we make are often biased, have selfish origins, etc. We don't want an AI to come with all those things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think there is one test to test an AI. This is because AI has many definitions, many types. Whether an AI is weak or strong can be tagged while looking for answers to questions like, &quot;I want that v/s I know I want that&quot;, &quot;Who am I and what exactly I am doing (from machine's perspective)&quot;, plus some other questions I mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7ZlO.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room" />

What are the advantages/disadvantages?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My answer to this question is that there are lots of problems where the solution can be found using searching. Take an example of Tic Tac Toe. If you are designing an intelligent computer player for this, then what you will do is that you will form a search space and then you will search for most optimal move which can be made to conclude the game. In these, scenarios you must be aware of optimal search strategies. Let's take another example, suppose if you are driving and want to got to an unknown person's house. It's far from your place and you decide to use GPS. Your GPS will use search algorithms to find the most optimal route that you can take to reach to the destination (of course there will be lots of factors to consider like traffic, etc. but this is the basic idea).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Disadvantages are only in terms of processing and storage. For slow algorithms you will be wasting lots of CPU time and storage as well but for good and efficient algorithms, you can preserve lots of space and also execute your task very fast. Of course, just learning about searching isn't AI. There's lot more to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What's more than &quot;searching&quot; in AI that could be taught in an introductory course?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is lots of things in AI other than searching. For example, learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforced), planning when one wants to design a system that will do certain actions independently and intelligently, representation of knowledge (known and unknown) and inference in agents which includes propositional logic and first-order logic, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are there theories behind AI that could be taught in this kind of course?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some topics could be taught like about different types of agents (simple reflex, model based, goal based, utility based and learning agent), different types of environments in which agents work, evaluation of agents. There could be some additional introductory topics like natural language processing, expert systems, etc." />

The research paper you're interested in is [Escaping from Children’s Abuse of Social Robots](http://www.irc.atr.jp/~drazen/pdf/HRI2015_Brscic.pdf).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In that research paper, researchers were able to program the robots to follow a planning simulation to reduce the probability of abuse by children. If it detects children, the robot is programmed to retreat into a crowd of adults (who can then discipline the children if needed). This happened because the researchers saw that it was only children who were beating up the robots in the mall in question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They discuss trying out other options though:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In this work the robot’s strategy to prevent abuse was to “escape”, i.e. move to a location where it is less likely abuse will occur. One could ask why the robot cannot overcome the abuse. In our preliminary trials we have tried several approaches, but we found that it is very difficult for the robot to persuade children not to abuse it. For example, we changed the robot’s wordings in many ways, using strong words, emotional or polite expressions, but none of them were successful. One partially successful strategy was the robot ‘physically’ pushing children. When its way was blocked, it would just try to keep going and behave as if it will collide into children and force its way through (under careful monitoring from a human operator). We observed that children at first accepted the robot’s requests and obeyed them; but, very soon they learned that they are stronger than the robot so they can win if they push, and also that they can stop it by pushing the bumper switch (attached on the robot for safety). After realizing that, they just continued with the abusive behavior. Obviously having a stronger robot would present a problem for safety and social acceptance so dealing with such abusive situations remains difficult.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But let's interrogate your question further:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If conscious AI is possible and is wide spread, wouldn't it be easy for someone who knows what they are doing to torture AI? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why would you consider such torture to be *wrong*? After all, one could argue that the machine won't really 'experience' pain if you torture it...so it should be morally okay to torture the machine then. It may be respond as *if* it is in pain, but it's dubious whether the ability to simulate an emotional state such as &quot;being in pain&quot; is equivalent to actually *being* in that emotional state. See the question [Is the simulation of emotional states equivalent to actually experiencing emotion?](http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/34779/is-the-simulation-of-emotional-states-equivalent-to-actually-experiencing-emotio/35815) for more discussion on this topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can make such an argument, but it won't really work on an emotional level because most humans would feel *empathy* towards the machine. It may be hard to justify it logically (and it may be based on humans' tendencies to engage in [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism)), but we feel this empathy. It's this empathy that caused you to ask this question in the first place, caused researchers to figure out how to protect a robot from being beaten up, enabled police officers to [arrest a drunken Japanese man for beating up a SoftBank robot](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/07/national/crime-legal/drunken-kanagawa-man-60-arrested-after-kicking-softbank-robot-in-fit-of-rage/#.WHj4Rccc9Lp), and made many humans upset over the destruction of [hitchBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT). And *that's* how AI abuse would be avoided - human empathy. If most humans care about the welfare of machines, they'll make it a priority to stop those few humans who are able and willing to abuse the machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: The OP has edited his *question* to clarify that he is talking about *software*, and not about robots. For robots, you can rely on anthropomorphism to produce some level of sympathy, but it's hard to sympathize with raw lines of code.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're not going to stop abuse of algorithms. Put it frankly, since the algorithms aren't like us, we aren't going to extend the same sort of empathy that we would to robots. Even chatbots are kinda iffy. If you could get people to sympathize with lines of code though (possibly by making a convincing simulation of emotion and sapience), then the above answer applies - humans anthropomorphize the machine and will come up with countermeasures. We aren't that level yet, so &quot;stopping AI abuse&quot; will be a low priority.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Still, some failsafes could be programmed in to limit the damage of abuse, as detailed in [this thread on chatbot abuse](https://www.chatbots.org/ai_zone/viewthread/1488/) - making the bot respond in a boring manner to make the abuser feel bored and move onto the next target, responding back to the abuser in a &quot;battle of wits&quot;, or even just blocking the abusers from using the service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These failsafes are cold comfort to those that want to *prevent* abuse, not respond to it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also...an abuser can happily learn how to program an AI to then abuse to his/her heart's content. Nothing can be done to stop that, and any possible measures to stop said abuse (such as monitoring every human being to make sure they don't program an AI to abuse) will probably cause more damage than it'd solve." />

Chatter Bots are used to communicate with a human and undergo conversations in such a way that the human which is communicating will think that he/she is talking to another human. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two types of chatter bots: One is which uses certain rules and pattern matching techniques and the other one is which uses actual artificial intelligence techniques. Of course, the latter one is the most difficult to implement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can be understood with an example. The former type of bots which uses pattern matching and rules consist of questions stored in the form,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    if question matches 'WHO (IS/ARE) (MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT/PRESIDENT)?' then&#xD;&#xA;         RETURN Y ... where Y is some predefined answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The latter part which uses actual AI techniques, uses various mechanisms to actually understand the question, extract information out of it, process the information into some standard normalized form and then do some **inference** w.r.t. the *facts* in the **knowledge base**. Such methods may use *learning* algorithms to actually learn question patterns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make simple bots (probably of the former type), you can use Artificial Intelligence Markup Language ([AIML](http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html)) which is a XML based language for developing chatter bots like [ALICE](http://alice.pandorabots.com/) bot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to focus more towards latter type of chatter bots, you may have to learn about various AI techniques, like searching, logic, knowledge and inference, learning, etc or sub-domains of AI like Natural Language Processing (NLP).

So the problem here is, is the 5th node in the 4th layer now fed forward or is it fed forward when the 3rd layer is done being fed forward? The 1st method would mean that the node would get fed forward 2 times and my concern is, if the output is still valid.

Then the concrete (SQL) query is used to find an answer in a target database.

I've read as much as I can on the subject (that I can grasp) and believe I understand all the broad concepts and some of the workings (despite being very weak in maths), neurons, synapses, weights, cost functions, backpropagation etc. However, I've not been able to figure out how to translate real world problems into a neural network solution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Case in point, Adam Geitgey gives as an example usage, a house price prediction system where given a data set containing **No. of bedrooms**, **Sq. feet**, **Neighborhood** and **Sale price** you can train a neural network to be able to predict the price of a house. However he stops short of actually implementing a possible solution in code. The closest he gets, by way of an example, is basic a function demonstrating how you'd implement weights:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood):&#xD;&#xA;      price = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # a little pinch of this&#xD;&#xA;      price += num_of_bedrooms * 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # and a big pinch of that&#xD;&#xA;      price += sqft * 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # maybe a handful of this&#xD;&#xA;      price += neighborhood * 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure&#xD;&#xA;      price += 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      return price &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other resources seem to focus more heavily on the maths and the only basic code example I could find that I understand (i.e. that isn't some all singing, all dancing image classification codebase) is an implementation that trains a neural network to be an XOR gate that deals only in 1's and 0's.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So there's a gap in my knowledge that I just can't seem to bridge. If we return to the **house price prediction** problem, hows does one make the data suitable for feeding into a neural network? For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* No. of bedrooms: 3&#xD;&#xA;* Sq. feet: 2000&#xD;&#xA;* Neighborhood: Normaltown&#xD;&#xA;* Sale price: $250,000&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can you just feed **3** and **2000** directly into the neural network because they are numbers? Or do you need to transform them into something else? Similarly what about the **Normaltown** value, that's a string, how do you go about translating it into a value a neural network can understand? Can you just pick a number, like an index, so long as it's consistent throughout the data?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of the neural network examples I've seen the numbers passing between layers are either 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. So at the end of processing, how do you transform the output value to something usable like **$185,000**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know the house price prediction example probably isn't a particularly useful problem given that it's been massively oversimplified to just three data points. But I just feel that if I could get over this hurdle and write an extremely basic app that trains using pseudo real-life data and spits out a pseudo real-life answer than I'll have broken the back of it and be able to kick on and delve further into machine learning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any help would be much appreciated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471" />

If your data is not well-behaved (i.e. fraught with outliers) then you may need to do more work normalizing the inputs and outputs. Some of the more advanced methods are described [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Note: I will assume that you are using f(x) = tanh(x) as your activation function. If you aren't, you should still be able to reason through how to normalize your data after reading this.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How to prepare the input data:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basic idea is that you want a significant variation in each input parameter to be reflected by a significant variation in the activation of the neuron those inputs are being fed into. By looking at a plot of the derivative of the tanh(x) actiavtion function, you'll see that the region of significant slope is within a distance of one or two from the origin. This means that whether the input to the activation function is 2000 or 3000 (values of x for which the derivative is negligibly small), the output of the activation will be almost identical...so your neuron's state will be independent of the difference between 2000 and 3000, and your network will never produce any predictive power from values in that range. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if you want to input the square footage of the house into a neuron, you need to *normalize* the square footage so that the network can tell the difference between 2000 and 3000. One way to do this so that all of the significant variations in your data are 'noticed' by the neuron is to **z-score-normalize the inputs**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Gather all of your square footage values (from your training set) and calculate the mean and standard deviation. *Store the mean and standard deviation*---you'll need this information to normalize new square footage values when testing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Normalize the vector of square footage values by subtracting the mean and then dividing the result by the standard deviation** (all operations element-wise of course). Subtracting the mean centers your data at the origin, and dividing by the standard deviation makes sure most of it is between -1 and 1, where the neuron's output is most sensitive to its input. This is called z-score normalization because each input value is replaced by its [z-score][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Do the above for each input variable.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, when you put each input value through a neuron, the output of the neuron is an activation between -1 and 1 (look at the image of tanh(x)). Since this is already in the 'sensitive' range of the activation function, you don't need to worry about altering the output of the input-layer neurons before sending them to the first hidden layer. Just **give any hidden layer neurons the outputs of the previous layer directly**---they will be able to handle them just fine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**When you reach the last layer (the output neuron(s)), what you get is again another activation between -1 and 1. You have to convert this back into a value for the house in question**, whether that value will be used as a prediction in a test set or to calculate error during training. However you do this, you just have to be consistent and use the same de-normalization procedure in training and testing. One way to think about it is: when the output neuron(s) returns 1, that means the network is returning the *maximum possible house value* as its prediction. *What should the highest value the network can estimate be?* The right approach here simply depends on your application. This is what I did:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Calculate the mean of [the/each] output variable and store it.&#xD;&#xA;- Calculate the maximum deviation of the output variable from the mean. &#xD;&#xA;  Python: `MaxDev = max([abs(DataPoint-numpy.mean(TrainingData)) for DataPoint in TrainingData])`&#xD;&#xA;- When the network returns output(s) between -1 and 1, multiply the output by `MaxDev` and add it to the mean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two basic quick checks you can do to see if your normalization-renormalization scheme is suitable (these are necessary, but perhaps not sufficient conditions):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. If all the input values are average (e.g. average no. of bedrooms, average sq.feet, etc), is the network's output equal to the average of the output variable (e.g. house value) as well? (It should be.)&#xD;&#xA; 2. If all the input values are unusually high/low, is the network's output unusually high/low as well? (This only works if all the inputs are positively related to the output...if some of them are inversely related related, you will have to think a bit more).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Observe that the scheme presented here satisfies these two conditions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Notice that this scheme would allow your network to only predict house values *inside* the range of house values in your training data set. Depending on the application, this behavior can be desirable or undesirable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example: you may want to make it impossible for your network to predict negative house values. Think about how you would do this. De-normalize the output so that -1 is mapped to 0.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to set no limit on the values your network can predict, then you can run the network's output through a function that maps the [-1,1] range to all real numbers...like arctanh(x)! As long as you do this during training your network will adjust its weights to accommodate this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have further questions. My ANN module is in Python, by the way, so I might have language-specific advice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~wylin/BA/Fusion_of_Biometrics_II.ppt&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" />

Logic programming refers to languages like [Prolog][6] where you have a [declarative][2] style of programming compared to a [imperative][3] style like you have in Pascal. Maybe you mean [if-statements][4] which are typical for imperative languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, representation means a certain level of abstraction. For instance, a model represents a certain part of the reality. Imagine a cup on a table. If the agent has a representation of this situation, it has a symbol `table` and a symbol `cup` which represents the things in the real world. Now it can have a relation `on(cup, table)` which represents the situation that the cup is on the table. This type of abstraction can be easily represented in a logic language like [first order logic][4]. Therefore, one uses logic programming languages like Prolog or other types of languages like [OWL][7] to represent knowledge and perform reasoning. So the important term to which Brooks refers is [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning][8].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, if your agent only have sensor data like video or sonar data, then it knows only distances or pixels from the real world. That is not meant with representation. Brooks' Creatures have only this information and calculate with this data directly to perform an action without reasoning. In that sense also artificial neural networks have no representation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, for an open source project to understand representation I would recommend the above mentioned OWL. You can look at the [Protégé][9] editor for working with OWL.

Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer/software program[intelligent Agent].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Robot Vision &amp; Machine Vision(intelligent vision)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robot Vision involves using a combination of camera hardware and computer algorithms to allow robots to process visual data from the world. For example, your system could have a 2D camera which detects an object for the robot to pick up. A more complex example might be to use a 3D stereo camera to guide a robot to mount wheels onto a moving vehicle.Just like Google's self driving Car. And remember robot vision is closely related to Machine Vision(though Machine Vision refers to the industrial use of vision for automatic inspection, process control).&#xD;&#xA;Without Robot Vision, your robot is essentially blind. This is not a problem for many robotic tasks, but for some applications Robot Vision is useful or even essential.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where it starts to get a little more complex is when we include Pattern Recognition into the family tree, or more broadly Machine Learning. This branch of the family is focused on recognising patterns in data, which is quite important for many of the more advanced functions required of Robot Vision. For example, to be able to recognise an object from its image, the software must be able to detect if the object it sees is similar to previous objects. Machine Learning, therefore, is another parent of Computer Vision alongside Signal Processing/image processing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, not all Computer Vision techniques require Machine Learning. You can also use Machine Learning on signals which are not images. In practice, the two domains are often combined like this: Computer Vision technique can detect features and information from an image, which are then used as an input to the Machine Learning algorithms. For example, Computer Vision technique detects the size and color of parts on a conveyor belt, then Machine Learning decides if those parts are faulty based on its learned knowledge about what a good part should look like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are such methods/techniques being used or worked on today?** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow and head of Brain team that just put [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning library into open source, gave the opening day keynote on deep learning, a powerful class of machine learning that allows machines to understand what they are seeing. These algorithms are trained by exposing them to huge amounts of data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example. 1000’s of tagged pictures of a car or people or animals, so they learn to recognize an unknown similar image very accurately, even if the object is somewhat obscured. They are now even able to interpret context. It’s not just a picture of a “baby”, but the algorithm comes back with “A baby is asleep next to a teddy bear”. it's therefore,quite impressive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*So,according to such scenario;you can analyse critically and guess what technique is applied! and real progress is made on this;don't forget that these are millions invested in these projects.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Gestalt Processing,inline with it's application(research with progress)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Advertisers are using the basic gestalt process in the television medium focus on how the viewer responds to the entire message for instance the sounds, colors and distinct images seen in the commercial. The response varies from viewer to viewer, depending on age, emotional background, physical condition, level of education and social class. How the individual responds is his gestalt. Depending on the product or service, advertisers target the message to specific viewer demographics, who share common gestalt responses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Similarity Principle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When conducting an ad campaign, marketers use the gestalt processing when reducing the product to a basic design theme, logo or slogan. Think of famous ad lines or instantly-recognizable symbols, such as McDonald's golden arches. That symbol evokes hamburgers and french fries to anyone remotely familiar with advertising, although the logo itself does not display food. Advertisers strive for individuality when marketing products, so the viewer or customer doesn't confuse their product with a competitor's item. However, under gestalt principles, customers won't confuse completely different products, such as cars and food, or clothes and electronics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Perception&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In advertising, perception is reality. Advertisers using gestalt principles must consider how the message they use is perceived by potential customers and how this message prompts action -- buying the product or service. Media and advertising professionals use gestalt theory to create effective ways to sell products whether using images or conceiving of the most beneficial forms of distribution. Figuring the overall success rate of using gestalt principles is also based in simplicity -- sales results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore;according to such scenario,companies like Amazoon,IBM,Google to mention but a few a have applied all the above methods or techniques and are still booming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This complements the abilities of a neural network well, because NNs only store knowledge implicitly in the weights and the information used to work on a single task is only stored in the activation of the network and degrades quickly the more information you add. ([LSTMs][3] are one try to slow down this degradation of short term memories, but it still happens.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, instead of keeping the necessary information in the activation, they presumably keep the addresses of memory slots for specific information in the activation, so these should also be subject to degradation.

I've read as much as I can on the subject (that I can grasp) and believe I understand all the broad concepts and some of the workings (despite being very weak in maths), neurons, synapses, weights, cost functions, backpropagation etc. However, I've not been able to figure out how to translate real world problems into a neural network solution. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Case in point, Adam Geitgey gives as an example usage, a house price prediction system where given a data set containing **No. of bedrooms**, **Sq. feet**, **Neighborhood** and **Sale price** you can train a neural network to be able to predict the price of a house. However he stops short of actually implementing a possible solution in code. The closest he gets, by way of an example, is basic a function demonstrating how you'd implement weights:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood):&#xD;&#xA;      price = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # a little pinch of this&#xD;&#xA;      price += num_of_bedrooms * 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # and a big pinch of that&#xD;&#xA;      price += sqft * 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # maybe a handful of this&#xD;&#xA;      price += neighborhood * 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure&#xD;&#xA;      price += 1.0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      return price &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other resources seem to focus more heavily on the maths and the only basic code example I could find that I understand (i.e. that isn't some all singing, all dancing image classification codebase) is an implementation that trains a neural network to be an XOR gate that deals only in 1's and 0's.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So there's a gap in my knowledge that I just can't seem to bridge. If we return to the **house price prediction** problem, hows does one make the data suitable for feeding into a neural network? For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* No. of bedrooms: 3&#xD;&#xA;* Sq. feet: 2000&#xD;&#xA;* Neighborhood: Normaltown&#xD;&#xA;* Sale price: $250,000&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can you just feed **3** and **2000** directly into the neural network because they are numbers? Or do you need to transform them into something else? Similarly what about the **Normaltown** value, that's a string, how do you go about translating it into a value a neural network can understand? Can you just pick a number, like an index, so long as it's consistent throughout the data?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of the neural network examples I've seen the numbers passing between layers are either 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. So at the end of processing, how do you transform the output value to something usable like **$185,000**?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know the house price prediction example probably isn't a particularly useful problem given that it's been massively oversimplified to just three data points. But I just feel that if I could get over this hurdle and write an extremely basic app that trains using pseudo real-life data and spits out a pseudo real-life answer than I'll have broken the back of it and be able to kick on and delve further into machine learning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471" />

I think the idea is that when an agent is given a problem, it must describe this problem in some internal manner that is efficient and accurately describes the problem.

That said, having the AI look for something like [Dactylic hexameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter) would be extremely useful, because you could feed it Homer. You could also feed it Homer in English in many different forms of English meter, and in almost every other living language. By definition, the AI would value works such as these, because max number_of_translations provides the most robust data set. When it starts to value meaning, this will be especially important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should also have a stanza marker, (possibly 00?). Because it looks for patterns within patterns, stanzas are valued.  Not all poetry has a stanza structure, but it arguably could. Deciding if stanzas are appropriate is partly a function of taking a syllabic divisor, breaking the poem down into number_of_lines, and looking at the divisors of that number. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would need an added function to be able to recognize meaning patterns.  For instance, repetition of proper nouns is the marker of plays. (From a meaning perspective, imo, plays is the ideal place to start because the marker is so easy to learn, and names all belong to a single set, and imply communication. It's no different functionally than any other identifier.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is obviously a very difficult task, but the number of syllables and stresses is fundamental numerical data of poetry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to validate to human tastes, you'd then have to use a captcha crowdsourcing method, for both the rhythmic stresses as input, and getting human reactions to different line-break configurations.  You would then reinforce the positive reactions, and the AI would tailor the line-break process to the audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, instead of utilizing human tastes and aesthetic sensibilities, you could instead let the AI decide what is preferred, which would probably be comprised of some sort of symmetry considered optimal to an algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following this logic, you wouldn't even need to have the AI learn the stresses, instead just focusing on raw syllables, or, numeric representation based on any factor. (With this method, the object is not to reformat poetry for humans, but for machines :)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is more about the aesthetics, but Cameron Browne's [Elegance in Game Design](http://www.cameronius.com/games/shibumi/browne-elegance-5.pdf) would seem to suggest there are engineering solutions to the type of aesthetic issues at the root of your problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I might start by teaching it to count the syllables of the poem, then having it look at the divisors. If it's roughly 10, it might be iambic pentameter. The AI doesn't care about the label, but it likes 10.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;20 syllables might represent a couplet in that meter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The time is out of joint, oh cursed spite&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that ever I was born to set it right&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd definitely start by feeding it older poetry, particularly poets that keep to strict meter. It's been a while since I've read Spencer and so forth, but I'd think poets of his time would be useful.  Dr. Seuss, perhaps the greatest wielder of the rhyming couplet, would surely be extraordinarily useful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The evaluation method would have to be fuzzy, because there would be increasing degrees of variance the more modern the poetry, ultimately resulting in free structures, except in the case of forms such as rap, which strongly utilize regularized rhythm. Machine learning is all about estimation and reinforcement, and is proving to be extremely useful dealing with fuzziness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;is a great example of modern line of poetry: the floor of 13 syllables / 2 makes a 6 beat line.  Understanding that in context with the surrounding verse is much more difficult and illustrates the nature of the problem. Even scanning the poem correctly to that point to determine would be extremely difficult. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, a different poem by the same author is extremely useful:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is the late November doing / With the disturbance of the spring / And creatures of the summer heat, / And snowdrops writhing under feet / And hollyhocks that aim too high / Red into grey and tumble down / Late roses filled with early snow? / Thunder rolled by the rolling stars / Simulates triumphal cars / Deployed in constellated wars / Scorpion fights against the sun / Until the Sun and Moon go down / Comets weep and Leonids fly / Hunt the heavens and the plains / Whirled in a vortex that shall bring / The world to that destructive fire / Which burns before the ice-cap reigns&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All lines of roughly 8 syllables, easy to pick out because of capitalization.

Differentiating between particles and other parts of speech provides a clue, because the poet's language is very compact: there are 19 nouns, verbs, or prepositions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More likely:&#xD;&#xA; - 19/5 = 3.8&#xD;&#xA; - 19/4 = 4.75&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Less likely:&#xD;&#xA; - 19/3 = 6.33&#xD;&#xA; - 19/6 = 3.16&#xD;&#xA; - 19/7 = 2.71&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further analysis might narrow it down.

While great for huge companies who can lure or buy the talent and deploy unlimited resources to gather data and crunch it, DL is simply neither accessible nor useful to the majority of us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although interesting and relevant, such kind of explanation does not really address the gist of the problem: What is lacking?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question seems broad, but it may be by lack of a simple answer.

The idea was to get away from the 1980's popular approach of a single global representation of all the components of the problem space that had required the task of robot task planning to juggle every  constraint in the world into one giant disordered mess of states and state transitions.  Rather than represent every element in the world in a single model (The Representation), Brooks suggested it was preferable to build a hierarchy of submodels of the world (subsets of states and transitions) in which smaller tasks could be more readily planned.  Then as these rudimentary skills were mastered, they could be combined to address a hierarchy of bigger and more complex tasks (bigger tasks subsume smaller tasks and benefit from their already having been solved).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, representation did not fully go away, but it was redistributed hierarchically so that much of the state could be abstracted away from the higher level of the bigger problem that you need to solve.  Planning became like coordinating a hierarchical army of skills, where the general doesn't need to plan every movement of the private in order to manage a battle.  Instead, that general need only tell the colonels what to do, and the colonels tell the majors, and so on down to the privates.  Now the general solves problems by coodinating multiple sub-hierarchies available to him/her by delegating authority to coordinate behavior at the appropriate level of abstraction: like division, brigade, battalion, company, and squad.  That's Brooks' Subsumption Architecure: the general needs to represent a battle plan only as &quot;the world according to colonels&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture" />

It quotes I.J. Good, who wrote in 1965:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultrainteltigent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an &quot;intelligence explosion,&quot; and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligeat machine is the *last* invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later on in the textbook, you have this question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;26.7 - I. J. Good claims that intelligence is the most important quality, and that building ultraintelligent machines will change everything. A sentient cheetah counters that &quot;Actually speed is more important; if we could build ultrafast machines, that would change everything&quot; and a sentient elephant claims &quot;You're both wrong; what we need is ultrastrong machines,&quot; What do you think of these arguments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems that the textbook question is an implicit argument against I.J. Good. Good may be treating intelligence as valuable, simply because man's strengths lies in that trait called &quot;intelligence&quot;. But other traits could be equally valued instead (speed or strength) and sentient beings may speculate wildly about their preferred traits being &quot;maximized&quot; by some machine or another.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This makes me wonder whether a singularity could occur if we had built machines that were *not* maximizing intelligence, but instead maximizing some other trait (a machine that is always increasing its strength, or a machine that is always increasing its speed). These types of machines can be just as transformative - ultrafast machines may solve problems quickly due to &quot;brute force&quot;, and ultrastrong machines can use its raw power for a variety of physical tasks. Perhaps a ultra-X machine can't build another ultra-X machine (as I.J. Good treated the design of machines as an intellectual activity), but a continually self-improving machine would still leave its creators far behind and force its creators to be dependent on it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, let's repeat my question -- Are technological singularities limited to ultra-intelligences? Or technological singularities be caused by machines that are not &quot;strong AI&quot; but are still &quot;ultra&quot;-optimizers?" />

Text="The underlying problem is combinatorial, as you note, but I'm not getting how you're ascribing value to words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key element of deciding line breaks, beyond the visual, is rhythmic. *(There are other factors, as Bob Salita notes, but you've gotta start somewhere.)*  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me you need to teach the computer how to scan a phrase in the poetic sense, which relates to rhythm.  This is obviously a very difficult task, but the number of syllables and stresses is fundamental numerical data of poetry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to validate to human tastes, you'd then have to use a captcha crowdsourcing method, for both the rhythmic stresses as input, and getting human reactions to different line-break configurations.  You would then reinforce the positive reactions, and the AI would tailor the line-break process to the audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, instead of utilizing human tastes and aesthetic sensibilities, you could instead let the AI decide what is preferred, which would probably be comprised of some sort of symmetry considered optimal to an algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following this logic, you wouldn't even need to have the AI learn the stresses, instead just focusing on raw syllables, or, numeric representation based on any factor. (With this method, the object is not to reformat poetry for humans, but for machines :)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is more about the aesthetics, but Cameron Browne's [Elegance in Game Design](http://www.cameronius.com/games/shibumi/browne-elegance-5.pdf) would seem to suggest there are engineering solutions to the type of aesthetic issues at the root of your problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I might start by teaching it to count the syllables of the poem, then having it look at the divisors. If it's roughly 10, it might be iambic pentameter. The AI doesn't care about the label, but it likes 10.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;20 syllables might represent a couplet in that meter:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The time is out of joint, oh cursed spite&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that ever I was born to set it right&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd definitely start by feeding it older poetry, particularly poets that keep to strict meter. It's been a while since I've read Spencer and so forth, but I'd think poets of his time would be useful.  Dr. Seuss, perhaps the greatest wielder of the rhyming couplet, would surely be extraordinarily useful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The evaluation method would have to be fuzzy, because there would be increasing degrees of variance the more modern the poetry, ultimately resulting in free structures, except in the case of forms such as rap, which strongly utilize regularized rhythm. Machine learning is all about estimation and reinforcement, and is proving to be extremely useful dealing with fuzziness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;is a great example of modern line of poetry: the floor of 13 syllables / 2 makes a 6 beat line.  Understanding that in context with the surrounding verse is much more difficult and illustrates the nature of the problem. Even scanning the poem correctly to that point to determine would be extremely difficult. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, a different poem by the same author is extremely useful:&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is the late November doing / With the disturbance of the spring / And creatures of the summer heat, / And snowdrops writhing under feet / And hollyhocks that aim too high / Red into grey and tumble down / Late roses filled with early snow? / Thunder rolled by the rolling stars / Simulates triumphal cars / Deployed in constellated wars / Scorpion fights against the sun / Until the Sun and Moon go down / Comets weep and Leonids fly / Hunt the heavens and the plains / Whirled in a vortex that shall bring / The world to that destructive fire / Which burns before the ice-cap reigns&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All lines of roughly 8 syllables, easy to pick out because of capitalization.  But the real question is: ~136 13 lines of roughly 10 syllables, or 17 lines of roughly 8?  It would want to calculate based on word blocks (words that cross syllabic thresholds and at least tell you where the break *cannot* be, and it should be possible to statistically divine the pattern, at least for regularized verse.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The wounded surgeon plies the steel / That questions the distempered part; /&#xD;&#xA;Beneath the bleeding hands we feel / The sharp compassion of the healer's art &#xD;&#xA;/ Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This verse highlight the problem.  5 lines of 4 beats, but syllabically: 8, 8, 8, 10, 12.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most likely: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 46/5 = 9.2&#xD;&#xA;- 46/4 = 11.5&#xD;&#xA;- 46/6 = 7.66&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Less likely:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- 46/3 = 15.3&#xD;&#xA;- 46/2 = 23  &#xD;&#xA;- 46/7 = 6.57&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2 lines has less perfect symmetry, but 5 lines is more likely, based on the overall number of syllables, and of the likely choices, has the least variance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately it would be looking for the underlying structure, or lack of structure, and try to reorganize the unbroken text into something *close* to the original structure.  While exactness is not always required because the process is ultimately subjective, and currently intractable, certain wrong choices would yield disastrous results. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the prior example it may be able to discern the likelihood of a 5 line pattern, but it would have to figure out on which lines to place the extra syllables.  Differentiating between particles and other parts of speech provides a clue, because the poet's language is very compact: there are 19 nouns, verbs, or prepositions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More likely:&#xD;&#xA; - 19/5 = 3.8&#xD;&#xA; - 19/4 = 4.75&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Less likely:&#xD;&#xA; - 19/3 = 6.33&#xD;&#xA; - 19/6 = 3.16&#xD;&#xA; - 19/7 = 2.71&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further analysis might narrow it down.  But extremely regularized verse remains the best place to start.  7 lines of roughly 10 syllables is &quot;poetic&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ‘The aged man that coffers-up his gold	&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Is plagu’d with cramps and gouts and painful fits;	 &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,	 &#xD;&#xA;&gt; But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,	 &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And useless barns the harvest of his wits;	 &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Having no other pleasure of his gain	&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But torment that it cannot cure his pain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It cares about both X and Y values.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Initially you want to keep it to a single language, because syllables may be treated differently.  That said, having the AI look for something like [Dactylic hexameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter) would be extremely useful, because you could feed it Homer. You could also feed it Homer in English in many different forms of English meter, and in almost every other living language. By definition, the AI would value works such as these, because max number_of_translations provides the most robust data set. When it starts to value meaning, this will be especially important.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Understanding different ways of treating syllables(long/short vs. stressed/unstressed) will also be essential as it transitions into more modern poetry.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here is a good link for basic English meter.](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/meter.html)  Iambic and Trochaic meters will be easy, while meters that employ Anapests, Dactyls and Spondees will be more challenging. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some cases, however, these will be mathematically interchangeable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I went to the Garden of Love, / And saw what I never had seen: / A Chapel was built in the midst, / Where I used to play on the green. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It doesn't matter if the lines above are iambic/trochaic or dactylic/anapestic, it's still 4 lines of roughly 8 syllables.  Thus &quot;I went to the Garden of Love&quot; is the same as &quot;The wounded surgeon plies the steel&quot;, even though the beats for the lines are 3 and 4, respectively.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should also have a stanza marker, (possibly 00?). Because it looks for patterns within patterns, stanzas are valued.  Not all poetry has a stanza structure, but it arguably could. Deciding if stanzas are appropriate is partly a function of taking a syllabic divisor, breaking the poem down into number_of_lines, and looking at the divisors of that number. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would need an added function to be able to recognize meaning patterns.  For instance, repetition of proper nouns is the marker of plays. (From a meaning perspective, imo, plays is the ideal place to start because the marker is so easy to learn, and names all belong to a single set, and imply communication. It's no different functionally than any other identifier, and a concept all computers &quot;understand&quot;.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eventually it would want to look for phonetic patterns, rhymes and near rhymes, which would also be indicators of potential good places for line breaks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a very big data set that it can look at, and who knows what it might discern?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Unfortunately we don't magically learn a representation that we can easily turn and twist, our ability to recognise objects from an unusual angle degrades with how uncommon the angle is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A nice thought experiment to illustrate the point: Imagine a cube sitting in front of you. Now pull one of the corners of the cube upwards until the cube is dangling in front of you, one corner pointing straight to the ceiling, the opposite corner pointing to the ground. Now indicate with your finger where the rest of the corner are. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are anything like me, this is really difficult. I think the first time I did't even realise I had to point out six corners! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course this is 3D and we might still have inbuilt 2D invariance, but it also turns out that faces that are turned upside down have to be processed much higher into the cortex to be recognised as faces and so on ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Concerning the learning of a lot of different feature vectors across the field of vision: This might be prevented by the fact that the neocortex learns sequences of input by predicting (via depolarisation) the next pattern. So you might have the situation that a higher level tells the lower level that there is an object moving from left to right and the lower level will predict that the edge it is detecting at point y will reoccur at point y+x.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This setup differs from the training of NNs in two ways: The data is already translational and the translation is predicted, which facilitates learning the same features. Basically two pattern recogniser close to each other get pretty much the same pattern one after the other whenever something moves in a certain direction and the second occurrence is predicted, which means it will be more likely detected, which means it will be learned. (I don't want to dole out a lecture about the cortex, but the prediction is a big deal because it allows neurons to fire quicker which means they beat other neurons before they are laterally inhibited and only if they actually fire will they learn.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a disclaimer I want to add that this is just my current understanding of the issue and I'm pretty sure the actual explanation is more complicated. For example I've read that one of the layers of the cortex is important for translational invariance and this layer only exists in the levels close to the sensory input. It is conjectured that this layer (L4) doesn't do the sequence prediction stuff, so maybe having the same kind of input is enough or learning different feature vectors is not actually a problem. There is also the complicating issue that there is poorly understood interplay between the different layers and different levels of the cortex. I would recommend to ask a neuroscientist, except I don't think they figured this out yet. " />

However, I felt something missing. We feel pain. The errors and bugs are just data. Let's say a robot can use machine learning and genetic programming to evolve. Can it learn to feel suffering ? And not just know it as mere information." />

After that, they will essentially be running the world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hint on the future of Civilization;** &#xD;&#xA;civilization has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures,science and arts that make it unique,with in a complex System.Therefore, Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus.Special thanks to [ancient Egyptians Civilization](http://www.crystalinks.com/egyptscience.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Artificial intelligence** (AI) is the name of these technologies. &#xD;&#xA;AI technologies are under development in every country of the world, &#xD;&#xA;and they are the technologies that will bring about the Singularity. &#xD;&#xA;AI technologies are improving rapidly; in fact, 2015 was a breakthrough year for AI,with advances of all kinds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These different advances are separate events now, but within a few years they'll merge into the first super-intelligent computers and robots that will lead to the Singularity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many analysts consider 2015 to have been a breakthrough year for Artificial Intelligence (AI), not because of any single achievement, &#xD;&#xA;but because of achievements across the board in so many different areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are now operating their own AI labs.In areas such as image recognition, computer vision, face recognition, &#xD;&#xA;voice recognition and natural language processing, there are a wealth of new products (think of Siri or OK Google) that are becoming increasingly reliable and increasingly available.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several companies are testing self-driving cars, &#xD;&#xA;and they’re expected to be available commercially by 2020. &#xD;&#xA;Robots in the military are becoming more common, from robots on wheels to pilotless drone warplanes. &#xD;&#xA;All of these robots still require constant human intervention and control, but they’re slowly migrating away from human control to algorithmically based decision making and control. &#xD;&#xA;Robot form factors are improving, with some robots looking almost human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Confusion from various sources**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Glimpse:Artificial Intelligence and Climate Change&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Politicians and climate change activists like to say that the claims about climate change have been endorsed by 95% of all the scientists in the world. &#xD;&#xA;This claim is a total fraud, because it confuses two things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - First, we have the claims by science that the earth is warming because of human activity. Arguably, that has been proven by scientists. But that’s all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The second part,is predictions about the future, which are mostly total crap, and certainly not science. In fact, climate change scientists have been making predictions for 25 years, and they’ve almost completely turned out to be wrong. &#xD;&#xA;The truth is that scientists who claim to know what the earth’s temperature will be in 2100 can’t even predict what the weather will be next month.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During my lifetime in artificial Intelligence field and being passionate about, I’ve read number of hysterical environment disaster predictions articles,written by different philosophers across the globe.&#xD;&#xA;My favorite is the prediction in 1970 by far left-wing Ramparts Magazine that predicted that the oceans were becoming so polluted that by 1980 the world’s oceans would be covered by a layer of algae. It didn’t happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way to know that the climate change activists are wrong is that these climate change activists never mention the Singularity or future technology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And we researchers in Artificial Intelligence,they undermine our visions which will pop out to be true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Proof that the Singularity will occur by 2030 or 2040**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A proof, based on reasonable assumptions, &#xD;&#xA;that any intelligent species on any planet in the universe will develop in a way that’s similar to the development of humans,&#xD;&#xA;including following the same Generational Dynamics cycles as humans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A glimpse:lets try to time travel back in 1800s,**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the late 1800s, streets in large cities were full of horses (think of a traffic jam in any large city, with horses instead of cars). &#xD;&#xA;These horses were producing huge volumes of urine, manure, flies and carcasses — not to mention cruelty to horses.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;By 1900, there was 1,200 metric tons of horse manure per day. &#xD;&#xA;There were international conferences (like today’s climate change conferences) that accomplished nothing. &#xD;&#xA;But within 20 years, the problem took care of itself because of new technology – the automobile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;History shows that new technology, including new AI technologies, will solve the “climate change” problem, &#xD;&#xA;and that politicians will have absolutely nothing to do with it, except to take the credit when something works, and to blame someone else otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Now lets come back from 1800s;**&#xD;&#xA;Early in 2005, the Pentagon announced the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS). &#xD;&#xA;By 2014, just a few years from now, America will be deploying thousands of computerized soldiers that will have the ability to decide on their own to kill people (hopefully, the enemy). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In early implementations, kills will be directed wirelessly by human overseers, but as millions of these are deployed, overseeing them will become increasingly impossible. &#xD;&#xA;By 2025, super-intelligent computerized robots manufactured in countries around the world will be fighting major battles. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*By 2030, super-intelligent computers will be running the world without our help.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Fiction or Facts from Science Fiction Movies:**&#xD;&#xA;Robot from I, Robot&#xD;&#xA;This is quite a different view of intelligent robots than the one in the movie I, Robot. It came out in summer, 2004, &#xD;&#xA;and it portrays a world in 2035 when super-intelligent robots are being manufactured for domestic home use. &#xD;&#xA;These robots are designed to be unable to harm human beings, but the story line is about a rogue robot who may be violating that rule. &#xD;&#xA;In the end, Will Smith conquers the malevolent robots and gets the girl, and everyone lives happily ever after. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Software algorithms that will bring singularity;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Intelligence isn’t some magical, mystical force. &#xD;&#xA;It’s actually the ability to find new ways to combine previous experiences in new ways. &#xD;&#xA;A new discovery is made by combining old discoveries in new ways, &#xD;&#xA;in the same way that jigsaw puzzle pieces can be put together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A computer can do the same thing by combining “knowledge bits” (KBs) in new ways, to learn new things, in the same way that jigsaw puzzle pieces can be combined. Computers can do this much faster than humans can.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Decisions can be made by using the same “minimax algorithm” that’s used to implement games like chess.&#xD;&#xA;This algorithm would work today, except that computers aren’t yet fast enough. &#xD;&#xA;The speed of computers doubles every 18 months, &#xD;&#xA;and by 2030 computers will be fast enough to implement this IC algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Another proof based on reasonable assumptions;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Every intelligent species in the universe must follow the same Generational Dynamics cycles as humans.. &#xD;&#xA;is outlined as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For any species (including humans) to survive, &#xD;&#xA;the population growth rate must be greater than the food supply growth rate. &#xD;&#xA;This is what I call “The Malthus Effect,” &#xD;&#xA;based on the 1798 book by [Thomas Roberts Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus), Essay on Population.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, for any species, there must be cyclical periods of extermination. &#xD;&#xA;This can be accomplished in several ways, such as war, predator, famine or disease. But one way or another, it has to happen.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;Non-intelligent species will simply starve and die quietly when there’s insufficient food. &#xD;&#xA;But intelligent species will form identity groups and hold riots and protests, and eventually go to war. &#xD;&#xA;These will be the cyclic crisis wars of extermination specified by Generational Dynamics and every intelligent species in the universe will have them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this can give you a glimpse,then just know Artificial Intelligence ain't no joke.....Lets study it hard...so that we see such a future.&#xD;&#xA;Special Thanks to **StackExchange**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

(For instance, it might develop a feeling analogous to &quot;being aggrieved&quot; over non-optimality in the algorithmic sense, or &quot;frustration&quot; at equations don't add up, or &quot;dissatisfaction&quot; over goals that have not been achieved.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The robot tormented by small children at the mall](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/children-beating-up-robot) can certainly be said to be &quot;suffering&quot; in that the children block the performance of the robot's function, but the robot is not conscious and suffering might be said to require awareness.  However, even without consciousness, this very simple robot can learn new behaviors through which it mitigates or avoids the &quot;suffering&quot; brought on by not being able to fulfill its function.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You definitely want to look into [the concept of suffering in a philosophical context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering#Philosophy) and [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus) would be a very useful place to start.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Epicurus is directly relevant in an algorithmic sense because he uses the term &quot;[ataraxia](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ataracia&amp;la=greek#lexicon)&quot; meaning calm, and is derived from the verb &quot;[tarasso](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tarassw&amp;la=greek)&quot; which means to agitate or disturb.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ataraxia can be mathematically expressed as an equilibrium.  Tarasso can be mathematically expressed as disequilibrium.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This relates directly to Game Theory in that disequilibrium can be said to be the primary requirements of games, and to AI in that Game Theory can be said to be the at root of all AI.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ataraxia is also understood in the sense of &quot;freedom from fear&quot;, which in temporal in that fear is a function of uncertainty as it relates to the future in a predictive sense, and involves current condition vs. possible, less optimal future conditions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus fear, which is a form of suffering, is rooted in computational intractability, even where the &quot;computer&quot; is is a human brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Early philosophers such as [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus) are especially useful because they were exploring critical, fundamental concepts, many of which can now be expressed with modern mathematics.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To wit: you can't arrive at suffering until you first define &quot;the Good&quot; and &quot;the Bad&quot;, which is a binary relationship in which neither term can be said to have meaning without the opposite.  (Mathematically, it can be expressed in its simplest form as a finite, one dimensional graph.)  This understanding is quite ancient. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is worth noting that the continuing value of the early philosophers is partly a factor of wisdom not being a dependent of volume of knowledge, demonstrated by Socrates in the idea that wisdom may be as simple as knowing you don't know something. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ancient sages didn't have the benefit of powerful measurement tools, advanced mathematics, or scientific method, but they were very smart, and even more importantly, wise. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Sometimes a greedy algorithm is the most convenient way to achieve an acceptable result, but the optimality is only local. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a mathematical level, the constructiveness or destructiveness of &quot;self interest&quot; in a system may be a function of whether a [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) is perceived.

One is to not use the GA as a direct classifier, but instead use a GA to learn the parameters of another classification model like a neural network.

This approach is to use evolutionary mechanics to evolve rule sets of the form &quot;if X condition is true, then do/classify Y&quot;. That's a more direct method of solving this sort of problem. You define some features on your dataset, and the algorithm tries to learn rules based on those features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with any of these approaches is just that there are so many better ways to solve the problem.

Ideally you will have a team of researchers available to read a (large?) number of sources and classify by hand whether the source is the original reference or just a repeater, and whether the topic is relevant.

If the problem of defining ultraintelligent machines (or even approximations to them) happens to fall in the class of, say, NEXPTIME-complete problems, and if there are no heuristic shortcuts, then even exponential progress in technology won't help—the speed of light puts a strict upper bound on how much computing can be done; problems beyond that limit will not be solved.

One way would involve several steps and would probably work best:&#xA;&#xA; 1. Use a trained Gaussian detector to filter out the car from the rest of the image&#xA; 2. Use a convolutional neural network to classify the car&#xA; 3. Use a neural network or a simple most common color algorithm to find the color of the car&#xA;&#xA;You would be able to implement this method most easily in MATLAB but you would also be able to do it in python with tensorflow or torch. You would probably be able to implement the trained Gaussian detector in tensorflow.&#xA;&#xA;Method 2:&#xA;&#xA; 1. Use a spatial transformer network to &quot;transform&quot; the image of the car for easy classification&#xA; 2. Use the output of the spatial transformer network for classification via a convolutional neural network.&#xA; 3. Use another neural network or a most common color algorithm to find the color of the car.&#xA;&#xA;This method would also work pretty well but using a spatial transformer network with a convolutional neural network may be hard to code because it is an area of developing research where there are many problems because the spatial transformer network and the convolutional neural network have to work well together and this is usually hard to get right.&#xA;&#xA;Method 3:&#xA;&#xA; 1. Use a convolutional neural network straight up on the input image maybe with down sampling to classify the car&#xA; 2. Use another neural network to find the color of the car&#xA;&#xA;I would personally go with method #1 because it would be fairly simple to implement with existing libraries such as tensorflow and it would most likely provide a high accuracy. &#xA;&#xA;As always I would also recommend that you use LIME during the development process to debug your model and determine what features you could add in or remove to help your model perform better.&#xA;&#xA;" />

Use a neural network or a simple most common color algorithm to find the color of the car&#xA;&#xA;You would be able to implement this method most easily in MATLAB but you would also be able to do it in python with tensorflow or torch.

Use another neural network or a most common color algorithm to find the color of the car.&#xA;&#xA;This method would also work pretty well but using a spatial transformer network with a convolutional neural network may be hard to code because it is an area of developing research where there are many problems because the spatial transformer network and the convolutional neural network have to work well together and this is usually hard to get right.&#xA;&#xA;Method 3:&#xA;&#xA; 1.

Use another neural network to find the color of the car&#xA;&#xA;I would personally go with method #1 because it would be fairly simple to implement with existing libraries such as tensorflow and it would most likely provide a high accuracy. &#xA;&#xA;As always I would also recommend that you use LIME during the development process to debug your model and determine what features you could add in or remove to help your model perform better.&#xA;&#xA;**Edit*&#xA;Since you need to detect certain patterns on the cars for color classification I would recommend that you use a convolutional neural network to classify these patterns. So your method would now look like this:  &#xA;1. Use a spatial transformer network or a filtered Gaussian detector to filter out the car&#xA;2. Use a convolutional neural network to classify the make and model of the car.&#xA;3.  Use another neural network that has either a convolutional or deep architecture to classify patterns and solid colors.

The skip gram model turns a word into a vector which allows it to be processed by other machine learning algorithms. Or , alternatively you can do some really cool addition and subtraction problems with the resulting vectors. With the skip gram model in your case you could generate a vector for your input and then compare it with other skip gram vectors and once you have found a near perfect match then that is the unabbreviated word. You could also look at using sparse distributed representations of words to do this. This approach is similar to the skip gram model except that instead of a vector with maybe 500 values a sparse representation may contain thousands of binary digits of which only a couple are positive or 1. If you would like to look at this approach take a look at cortical.io which has free API that you can use.

A nice feature of that journal is that every special issue has an editorial (a special &quot;article&quot; at the beginning of each journal), in which there is a section called &quot;service&quot;. This service section lists publication media (like journals) and conferences etc. that are related to the given special issue. So, in case you are interested in journals of a special field of AI (like human-computer interaction), just search for a special issue that is related to that topic and read the editorial's service part." />

First, let's start with the architecture. A NN has 3 regions, the input layer, the hidden layers and the output layer. The input layer depends on the number of features in your dataset. The hidden layers, you can have multiple layers all of different breadth (number of nodes per layer). The output layer depends on the number of classes in your dataset. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An easy example is applying a NN to the MNIST datatset. This is a dataset which contains handwritten digits between 0-9. Let's assume each of these images is 16*16=256 pixels. Thus, you will need 256 input nodes. And you will need 10 output nodes, one for each possible output. The hidden layers can be set in any way you can creatively imagine. There are however ways to optimize your hidden layer to get the best performance possible while not spending too much computational power. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is always how a NN works. The beauty of a NN is that you only need to code it once and it can learn any function. All you need to do is change your architecture, but the underlining principles will always be the same. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your case, you want to do segmentation. This is often done using a window around the pixel you want to classify. Popular choices are 3*3 or 5*5 pixels. The choice of your considered window will determine the number of nodes in your input layer. Then you want to classify them as one of two classes, thus you need 2 output nodes. You can also use just 1, but I don't recommend it, I can expand on this if you care.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One caveat of NN is that you will need quite a bit of training data. So get ready to classify a lot of pixels manually. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How to know how many layers in hidden layer? How to know how many nodes per layer in the hidden layer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, for simple operations like the one you are trying to learn you do not need to have multiple layers. One hidden layer should be enough, at most 2. But, how do you determine the number of nodes you should use? You need to use some model validation techniques to do this. One way is through grid search and cross-validation. Train, and re-train your model with multiple number of nodes and then compare their performances to identify the optimal number of nodes. To get good results this does require a large dataset.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rule of thumb: 1 hidden layer for NN! Don't get dragged into deep models if you don't need them. " />

Their main benefit is their finite ability and flexible nature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with procedural programing to solve problems is you have to know what the computer needs to do in order to solve the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What deep learning does is remove the requirement of the programmer to know how to solve the problem by having them only need to know what the computer needs to know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the entire premise of neural networks. The programmer writes the program for data points required to be known in order to solve a particular problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The computer is given an input it comes up with an answer.&#xD;&#xA;If it's answer is wrong it needs to make the answer it gave less likely and the right answer more likely.&#xD;&#xA;The goal is to get the computer to always get the right answer. If the computer always gets the wrong answer then the neural network it too small.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What deep learning is, is a neural network that is deep.&#xD;&#xA;To answer this you need to know how a neural network is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A neural network is based on a neuron:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Finite number of `boolean' inputs (More then one)&#xD;&#xA; * A weight is attached on each input to define how important&#xD;&#xA;   often though as a float between -1 and 1, but it's just a percentage of how likely each input changes the answer.&#xD;&#xA; * One boolean output&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A neuron can be a class or function the implementation really doesn't matter. The weight of each input changes as more answers are asked and responses verified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The depth of a neural network is has one layer  when there is one row of neurons between the input and output.&#xD;&#xA;two layers when a few neurons make decisions on inputs and a final neuron or multiple neurons make decisions biased on those neurons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A neural network is called deep when there are at least four layers of neurons?

While the programmer has no need to know how decisions are made by the computer they still need to know what questions or nodes need to be added.&#xD;&#xA;The reason this is a problem is if the nodes responsible aren't there the program will be wrong in strange cases and have no way of correcting this on it's own. The larger the network the harder it is to solve these kinds of problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will lead to an inevitable solution to have the computer self improve by some type of generative algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;This has it's own breadth of problems as if not built properly could grow into something unintended which wastes time and money if it fails quickly, and could be potentially dangerous if it appears to work and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer to AI will be a combination of deep neural networks some generative type programing and some new ideas and innovations." />

In a common pattern in development of new technology (known as hype cycle), an event, typically a technological breakthrough, creates publicity which feeds on itself to create a &quot;peak of inflated expectations&quot; followed by a &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot;. Since scientific and technological progress can't keep pace with the publicity-fueled increase in expectations among investors and other stakeholders, a crash must follow. AI technology seems to be no exception to this rule.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And it seems that this paragraph indicates that *any* new technology will be stuck in this pattern of &quot;inflated expectations&quot; followed by disillusionment.

A human is alive. But is a single bacterial cell, or a single cell from your own body? They reproduce, they eat, etc. so yes they are alive. They are not like a dog or a cat however. In fact, a bacterial colony in a pool of water, giving off a yellow or brown color can be mistaken as a mineral or mud. It is only when you look closer that you see it is actually life. What about a biological virus? It is not made of cells. It does not have DNA. Most would agree it has life. But is does not really seem to be as alive as say, a shark or giraffe. Many people do not think a car is alive. Yet cars evolve. They move, they &quot;eat.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;Life is simply a way we define things around us. A much more useful and definitive way to categorize life I think, would be to utilize a continuum instead of an all or nothing approach. Rocks would go on the end of &quot;nonliving.&quot; Intelligent, multicellular; self-aware entities could perhaps be on the other end as &quot;fully alive.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Other entities can go in between. As for something such as AI, I would propose adding a z-axis, to make a 3 dimensional continuum, allowing for a self aware, intelligence entity not made of cells to fit comfortably with humans without causing an all-or-nothing.&#xA;&#xA;PS: thought I came to this conclusion myself, I have a suspicion someone smarter than me has already written about such an idea.

So in that sense, the answer to your question in a very general sense is &quot;yes&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But these days, the stuff that is state-of-the-art in machine learning / AI is usually more about finding sets of weights for functions that match a pattern or whatever.  In Neural Networks, for example, the NN isn't writing any code, it's just running through an algorithm that incrementally changes some weights (or coefficients) such that when you enter a certain input, you get an output that's close to the desired output.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then you have approaches like using a Genetic Algorithm to evolve the weights in the NN, as opposed to using back-propagation.  To the extent that GA's are a little closer to the idea of &quot;an AI coding itself&quot; (although not exactly), you could kinda sorta consider that an example of what you're asking about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Is there a specific flowchart to describe artificial intelligence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not even close.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're interested in exploring all of this further, I'd suggest reading the book *The Master Algorithm* by Pedro Domingos, and take Andrew Ng's MOOC on Machine Learning on Coursera.

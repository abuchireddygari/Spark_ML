However, there's indeed a bias towards them in practice. Although most functional languages are impure (that is, they allow side effects), and such can't count as &quot;declarative&quot;, a few languages are purely functional (that is, they don't allow side effects), most prominently &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Functional_programming&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;.

An imperative program describes &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, &quot;function&quot; is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function's arguments. That is, the function's output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;.

For the typical imperative language's definition of &quot;function&quot;, the above doesn't hold. For instance, C's &lt;code&gt;getchar()&lt;/code&gt; does not always return the same value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is 3.

In mathematics, you don't worry about how is the set &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; supposed to be computed, but rather about &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;'s definition itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in Python (in imperative style):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_prime(n):&#xA;  for x in range(2, n):&#xA;    if n % x == 0:&#xA;      return False&#xA;&#xA;  return True&#xA;&#xA;def foo():&#xA;  s = set()&#xA;  n = 2&#xA;  while len(s) &amp;lt; 10:&#xA;    if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:&#xA;       s.append(n)&#xA;&#xA;  return set(s)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there's an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don't use it, it's our fault, not Python's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Haskell steps in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import qualified Data.Set as Set&#xA;&#xA;isPrime :: Integer -&amp;gt; Bool&#xA;isPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]&#xA;&#xA;s = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haskell's version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the &lt;code&gt;isPrime&lt;/code&gt; function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; itself. The compiler, more often than not &lt;a href=&quot;https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm. GHC's optimizer is known to be one of the strongest in the world, not because its the best compiler of 'em all, but because Haskell's nature allows for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haskell (and other functional languages), in summary, have several features that make it look, taste, and behave like pure math:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referential transparency and purity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Haskell is lazy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/279316/what-exactly-makes-the-haskell-type-system-so-revered-vs-say-java&quot;&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; strong type system&lt;/a&gt;, with such exotic (but very useful!) stuff as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;recursive&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;algebraic&lt;/a&gt;) data types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the bottom line is that AI researchers often prefer functional languages over imperative languages (or, more assertively, pure over impure languages), because they are attempting to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; artificial intelligence itself, by means of functions (relationship between an input and an output). At the end, we do this because we have no real algorithm for human-level intelligence to raise from a handful of transistors.

There is still momentum due to so many people using it in the past, who are still active in the industry or research (anecdote: the last VCR was produced by a Japanese maker in July 2016, yes). The language is however used (to my knowledge) for the kind of AI that does not leverage Machine Learning, typically as the reference books from Russell and Norvig. These applications are still very useful, but Machine Learning gets all the steam these days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the decline is that LISP practitioners have partially moved to Clojure and other recent languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are learning about AI technologies, LISP (or Scheme or Prolog) is good choice to understand what is going on with &quot;AI&quot; at large.

Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and &quot;purely functional&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Situation Calculus&lt;/a&gt;, where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a &quot;world&quot;, and can let it evolve to compute &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt;---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frame problem&lt;/a&gt;, meaning this calculus cannot tell what does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP's fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)).

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Turing machine&lt;/a&gt; consists of a finite state machine and an infinite tape. A TM does run an algorithm, determined by its initial state and the state transition matrix, but what I think you are talking about is Universal Turing Machines (UTM)  that can read &quot;code&quot; (which is usually a description of another Turing machine) written on a &quot;code segment&quot; of the tape and then simulate that machine on input data written on the &quot;data segment&quot; of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turing machines can differ in the number of states in their finite state machines (and also in the alphabet they write on the tape but any finite alphabet is easily encoded in binary so this should not be the big reason for differences among Turing machines). So, you can have UTMs with bigger state machines and UTMs with smaller state machines. The bigger UTM could possibly surpass the smaller one if they use the same encoding for the &quot;code&quot; part of the tape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also play around with the code used to describe the TM being simulated. This code could be C++ for example, or could be a Neural network with the synapse strength written down as a matrix. Which description is better for computation depends on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example comparison among UTMs with different state machines: consider different compilers for the same language, say C++. Both of them will first compile C++ to assembly and then run another UTM which reads and executes assembly (your physical CPU). So, a better compiler will run the same code faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to humans vs computers, humans are neural networks that run algorithms like those you would write in C++. This involves a costly and inefficient conversion of the algorithm into hand movements. A computer uses a compiler to convert C++ to assembly that it can run natively, so its able to do a much more efficient implementation of C++ code. Alternately, humans have a ton of neurons, and the neural code, i.e. synapse strength, is hard to read, so current computers cannot run that code yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="130" LastEditorUserId="130" LastEditDate="2016-08-03T01:01:12.243" LastActivityDate="2016-08-03T01:01:12.243" CommentCount="3" />

These effects will all be indirect--for example, AI empowering an app or gadget that helps you sleep better won't &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; augment your intelligence, but will cause population-level increases in effective intelligence through reducing sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't talked yet about nootropics, chemicals that increase intelligence, but it's reasonable to expect that AI will improve drug discovery there like it improves drug discovery for anything else.

As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who for genetic reasons will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the &lt;strong&gt;initial generation&lt;/strong&gt;, a population composed of different &lt;strong&gt;individuals&lt;/strong&gt; is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called &lt;strong&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt;, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An individual is coded as a &lt;strong&gt;genotype&lt;/strong&gt;, which can have any shape, such as a** bit vector (&lt;strong&gt;genetic algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a &lt;strong&gt;phenotype&lt;/strong&gt; when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called &lt;strong&gt;direct&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;coding&lt;/strong&gt;. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 01010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the transition from the old to the new generation are called &lt;strong&gt;variation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;operators&lt;/strong&gt;, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals.

In fact, they do just that for randomly generated images (e.g. those in generation 0 of the evolutionary run)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original goal of the researchers was to use the neural networks to automatically generate images that look like the real things (by getting the recognizer's feedback and trying to change the image to get a more confident result), but they ended up creating the above art.

Unfortunately it seems, this SE site does not support LaTex:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Document summarization is very much an open problem in AI research. One way this task is currently handled is called &quot;extractive summarization&quot;. The basic strategy is as follows: Split this document into sentences and we will present as a summary a subset of sentences which together cover all the important details in the post. Assign sentence i, 1&amp;lt;=i&amp;lt;=n, a variable z_i \in {0,1}, where z_i = 1 indicates the sentence was selected and z_i = 0 means the sentence was left out. Then, z_i z_j = 1 if and only if both sentences were chosen. We will also define the importance of each sentence w_i for sentence i and interaction terms w_{ij} between sentences i and j. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let x_i be the feature vectors for sentence i. w_i = w(x_i) captures how important it is to include this sentence (or the topics covered by it) while w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) indicates the amount of overlap between sentences in our summary. Finally we put all this in a minimization problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;maximize_{z_i} \sum_{i} w_i z_i - w_{ij} z_i z_j &#xA;s.t. z_i = 0 or 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This tries to maximize the total weight of the sentences covered and tries to minimize the amount of overlap. This is an integer programming problem similar to finding the lowest weight independent set in a graph and many techniques exist to solve such problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This design, in my opinion, captures the fundamental problems in text summarization and can be extended in many ways. We will discuss those in a bit, but first we need to completely specify the features w. w_i = w(x_i) could be a function only of the sentence i, but it could also depends on the place of the sentence in the document or its context (Is the sentence at the beginning of a paragraph? Does it share common words with the title? What is its length? Does it mention any proper nouns? etc)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) is a similarity measure. It measures how much repetition there will be if we include both words in the sentence. It can be defined by looking at common words between sentences. We can also extract topics or concepts from each sentence and see how many are common between them, and use language features like pronouns to see if one sentence expands on another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To improve the design, first, we could do &lt;em&gt;keyphrase extraction&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. identify key phrases in the text and choose to define the above problem in terms of those instead of trying to pick sentences. That is a similar problem to what Google does to summarize news articles in their search results, but I am not aware of the details of their approach. We could also break the sentences up further into concepts and try to establish the semantic meaning of the sentences ( Ponzo and Fila are people P1 and P2, a mall is a place P, P1 and P2 went to the place P at time T (day). Mode of transport walking.... and so on). To do this, we would need to use a semantic ontology or other common-sense knowledge database. However, all the parts of this last semantic classification problem are open and I have not seen anyone make satisfactory progress on it yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could also tweak the loss function above so that instead of the setting the tradeoff between the sentence importance w_i and the diversity score w_ij by hand, we could learn it from data. One way to do this is to use Conditional Random Fields to model the data, but many others surely exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this answer explained the basic problems that need to be solved to make progress towards good summarization systems.

It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is designed to emphasize usability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in many other languages such as &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/c&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;, and the language has constructs intended to be used to create clear programs in a variety of domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two similar but incompatible versions of Python are in widespread use (2 and 3). Please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using when asking a question about Python.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/scheme&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;scheme&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;scheme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/ruby&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ruby&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/perl&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;perl&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;perl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/tcl&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;tcl&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;tcl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like other &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dynamic languages&lt;/a&gt;, Python is often used as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/tags/scripting/info&quot;&gt;scripting language&lt;/a&gt;, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/cpython&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cpython&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cpython&lt;/a&gt;, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zen of Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; written by Tim Peters, which can be revealed by issuing this command at the interactive interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import this&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The documentation can also be accessed offline for your installation of Python in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Going into &lt;code&gt;Your_Python_install_dir/Doc&lt;/code&gt;. There is a complete Python documentation present for the version of Python installed on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;pydoc x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;python -m pydoc x&lt;/code&gt; from the command prompt or terminal displays documentation for module &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many other languages Python uses an indentation based syntax and this may take some getting used to for programmers familiar with braces for syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from __future__ import braces&#xA;  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1&#xA;SyntaxError: not a chance&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help with the transition it is a recommendation to use a properly configured text-editor created for programmers or an IDE. Python comes with a basic IDE called &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IDLE&lt;/a&gt; to get you started. Other popular examples are the charity-ware &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/vim&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;vim&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt;, the free GNU &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/emacs&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;emacs&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/eclipse&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;eclipse&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;eclipse&lt;/a&gt;+&lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/pydev&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pydev&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pydev&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/pycharm&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pycharm&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pycharm&lt;/a&gt;.

DNNs effectively work (though not exactly) by matching patches in the images to a &quot;dictionary&quot; of patches, one stored in each neuron (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.google.com/archive/unsupervised_icml2012.html&quot;&gt;the youtube cat paper&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, it may not have a high level view of the image since it only looks at patches, and images are usually downscaled to much lower resolution to obtain the results in current generation systems. Methods which look at how the components of the image interact may be able to avoid these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions to ask for this work are: How confident were the networks when they made these predictions?

Personally I think it's close to self-evident that the brain works largely in a probabilistic fashion, but it's also clear that we do sometimes use symbolic processing / deductive logic / rules / etc.  And right now, ANN's don't give you much in the way of reasoning, deduction, etc.  So we may ultimately find that we have to combine a probabilistic approach like ANN's with other techniques - maybe Inductive Logic Programming or something of that nature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2016-08-04T00:57:01.833" CommentCount="0" />

I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; rejected from any top-tier journal. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crossover functions are easy to define and natural&lt;/strong&gt;: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Box evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception: Simulations&lt;/strong&gt;. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;modelling locomotion patterns&lt;/a&gt;. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PDE constrained optimization&lt;/a&gt;, so this may change in the future.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not Appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can calculate a gradient&lt;/strong&gt; for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know the fitness function in closed form&lt;/strong&gt;: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;automatic differentiation&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;subgradient descent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a &lt;strong&gt;linear program or a quadratic program&lt;/strong&gt;: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your solution space is small&lt;/strong&gt;: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies.

In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an essay entitled &quot;The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and&#xA;  his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane&#xA;  winds up pregnant by Buck.

Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search&quot;&gt;Monte Carlo Tree Search&lt;/a&gt;. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won't be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point.

I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy&quot;&gt;stigmergy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones &lt;em&gt;add up&lt;/em&gt;, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get &quot;together as they move&quot;, forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the &quot;field-based motion coordination model&quot; (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other's field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple &quot;logic&quot; code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my &lt;em&gt;dating&lt;/em&gt; knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena&quot;&gt;Mamei and Zambonelli&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems&quot;&gt;Weyns et al.&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;resilient&lt;/em&gt;: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen.

Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a must create an artifact o of type t;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is&#xA;  any criterion expressible in natural language;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied&#xA;  that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a human referee r determines the combination of t and C&#xA;  to not be unrealistic for an average human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to &lt;em&gt;compare&lt;/em&gt; the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2016-08-30T19:42:55.163" LastActivityDate="2016-10-08T01:47:41.487" Title="Has the Lovelace Test 2.0 been successfully used in an academic setting?"

In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastActivityDate="2016-08-08T04:44:18.407" CommentCount="0" />

Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that's surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when there's a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-08-09T15:32:41.270" CommentCount="1" />

Examples might not be 100% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="210" LastActivityDate="2016-08-11T09:00:25.247" CommentCount="3" />

For example, genes A and B might contribute to fitness only when they’re both set to 1: if either is set to 0, then the fact that the other is set to 1 doesn’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that &lt;em&gt;crossover is not a global operator&lt;/em&gt;.

This could be from Franck's example (moving and shooting) for an AI, or perhaps it could be predicted 2 outputs in a genetic machine learning scenario, but really most scenarios where GAs are applied are synonymous (even at solving a single task, there may be different aspects of the task to be addressed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we had an individual, 1, that was performing reasonably well at both tasks, and we found a series of mutations which produced 2 new individuals, 2 and 3, which performed better than Individual 1 at tasks 1 and 2 respectively. Now while both of these are improvements, ideally we want to find a generally good solution, so we want to combine the features that we have been found to be beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where crossover comes in; by combining the genomes of Individuals 2 and 3, we may find some new individual which produces a mixture of their performances. While it is possible that such an individual could be produced by a series of mutations applied to Individual 2 or Individual 3, the landscape may simply not suit this (there may be no favorable mutations in that direction, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bsVBEm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bsVBEm.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are partially right therefore; it may sometimes be the case that the benefits of crossover could be replicated with a series of mutations.

In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it's standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible.

None of this is even as sophisticated as the behavior of a flea, but no one refers to insects as &quot;intelligent.&quot; It's exciting stuff that allows us to solve problems that human intelligence often has difficulty with (such as classification of thousands of objects, which would tire an ordinary human mind), but it's nowhere close to replicating our higher brain functions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that the Turing test is a poor test of &quot;intelligence&quot; that defies common sense. By the same extension, mistaking a mannequin for a human being in the dark does not mean that the mannequin is actually human. If it were a valid test, then we passed that way back around 1980 with programs like Dear Eliza which were coded in BASIC to regurgitate human speech patterns. There's just no need to come up with a sophisticated argument like Searle's Chinese Room to debunk it, since it's silly on its face; any layman should be able to see right through the Turing Test. If anyone except Turing had come up with this test it would not have received much attention. Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What &quot;intelligence&quot; consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we've successfully built it; we've not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we're nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows &quot;intelligent,&quot; but our AI today isn't even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not going to be a popular answer - I'll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There's far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we've achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can't even define; we can't say for sure what A.I. really is, but we're adamantly certain that we're close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if &quot;brute force algorithms&quot; exist when we're still groping for an understanding of what it is we're trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle's Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we're limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn't even work yet (like Google's self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can't answer without first defining intelligence.

To understand what's going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The &quot;Activation Function&quot;, a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you refer to the value of a node; there isn't a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman's terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set. By doing this until we find an optima (a point where all movements increase error), we can find some 'good' configuration of weights for that particular ANN. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a nice tutorial on BP here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html&lt;/a&gt;.

One engine simply does &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Named Entity Recognition&lt;/a&gt; using OpenNLP.  This identities discrete named &quot;things&quot; - people, places, companies, etc.  Another engine does entity matching with a pre-established database of entities - specifically (in the out-of-the-box configuration) a dump of entities from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dbpedia.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DBPedia&lt;/a&gt;.

Before NER can happen there is parsing and tokenizing and other NLP activities.

Commiting a crime, unlike falling, is a complex behavior, and takes so many forms. A camera watching a store's counter like at a 7-11 could perhaps see that the 'customer''s arm is strangely reaching across the counter, and the attendant is moving a lot more than usual suddenly, but aside from very specific cases like this such a system is currently quite unfeasible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crimes are unusual, relatively speaking, and their dramatic nature means that even the simplest crimes play out in very different ways.

The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don't require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to &quot;see&quot; new kinds of links between &quot;entities&quot;, as with the presentation's example of identifying research communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Past slide 20, the presentation goes into some serious mathematics.

Again, note that &quot;displaying&quot; emotions and &quot;feeling&quot; emotions are two completely different things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can program a thing like paro to modulate the voice tones or facial twitches to express sympathy, affection, companionship, or whatever - but while doing so, a paro does NOT empathize with its owner - it is simply faking it by performing the physical manifestations of an emotion.

To test whether you have something useful or not, you might want to implement your S2V in a mouse foraging simulation - see whether it produces typical behavior and if any cooperative or competitive dynamics can organically grow out of your S2V.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some further info on the subject: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Glasgow University claimed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that there are four primary emotions: happiness, sadness, fear and anger. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; provides nice (if somewhat short) hierarchical breakdown of secondary and tertiary emotions under primary emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1712" LastEditorUserId="145" LastEditDate="2016-08-25T20:07:22.267" LastActivityDate="2016-08-25T20:07:22.267" CommentCount="1" />

Their applicability (relative to metaheuristics) is as a 'rapid prototyping tool': the original motivation was to allow non-expert practitioners to apply metaheuristics to their specific optimization problem (e.g. &quot;Travelling-Salesman (TSP) plus time-windows plus bin-packing&quot;) without requiring expertise in the highly-specific problem domain. The idea was that this could be done by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allowing practitioners to implement only very simple (effectively,&#xA;randomized) heuristics for transforming potential solutions. For&#xA;example, for the TSP: &quot;swap two random cities&quot; rather than (say) the more&#xA;complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lin-Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; heuristic. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Achieve effective results (despite using these simple heuristics) by combining/sequencing them in an intelligent way, typically by employing some form of learning mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-heuristics can be described as 'selective' or 'generative' depending on whether the heuristics are  (respectively) sequenced or combined. Generative hyper-heuristics thus often use methods such as Genetic Programming to combine primitive heuristics and are therefore typically customized by the practitioner to solve a specific problem. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44119367/Hyper-heuristics_Learning_To_Combine_Sim20160326-8451-ouh5fe.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;amp;Expires=1472329757&amp;amp;Signature=KT1E2ATKreC%2BGlTvPmJGYBFRSRY%3D&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DHyper-heuristics_learning_to_combine_sim.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; on generative hyper-heuristics used a Learning Classifier System to combine heuristics for bin-packing. Because generative approaches are problem-specific, the comments below do not apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/papers/evocop02exs.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;original motivator&lt;/a&gt; for selective hyper-heuristics was that researchers would be able to create a hyper-heuristic solver that was then likely to work well in an unseen problem domain, using only simple randomized heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way that this has traditionally been implemented was via the introduction of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~goc/papers/ChapterClassHH.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'hyper-heuristic domain barrier'&lt;/a&gt; (see figure, below), whereby generality across problem domains is claimed to be achievable by preventing the solver from having knowledge of the domain on which it is operating. Instead, it would solve the problem by operating only on opaque integer indices into a list of available heuristics (e.g. in the manner of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'Multi-armed Bandit Problem'&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional notion of Selective Hyper-heuristic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this 'domain blind' approach has not resulted in solutions of sufficient quality. In order to achieve results anywhere comparable to problem-specific metaheuristics, hyper-heuristic researchers have had to implement complex problem-specific heuristics, thereby failing in the goal of rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is still possible &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt; to create a selective hyper-heuristic solver which is capable of generalizing to new problem domains, but this has been made more difficult since the above notion of domain barrier means that only a very limited feature set is available for cross-domain learning (e.g. as exemplified by a popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5462&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;selective hyper-heuristic framework&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more recent research perspective towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'whitebox' hyper-heuristics&lt;/a&gt; advocates a declarative, feature-rich approach to describing problem domains. This approach has a number of claimed advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Practitioners now need no longer &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; heuristics, but rather simply &lt;em&gt;specify&lt;/em&gt; the problem domain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It eliminates the domain-barrier, putting hyper-heuristics on the same 'informed' status about the problem as problem-specific metaheuristics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With a whitebox problem description, the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;'No Free Lunch' theorem&lt;/a&gt; (which essentially states that, considered over the space of all &lt;em&gt;black box&lt;/em&gt; problems, Simulated Annealing with an infinite annealing schedule is, on average, as good as any other approach) no longer applies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: I work in this research area, and it is therefore impossible to remove all personal bias from the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2016-08-28T07:36:35.337" LastActivityDate="2016-08-28T07:36:35.337" CommentCount="1" />

This&#xA;  body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it&#xA;  “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI). What distinguishes AGI work from&#xA;  run-of-the-mill “artificial intelligence” research is that it is explicitly focused&#xA;  on engineering general intelligence in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even if this is the origin of the specific phrase &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot;, I am pretty sure people were making the distinction between &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;task specific&quot; techniques much earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia article on AGI also has a clue, where it states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or &quot;applied AI&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That section cites this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into &quot;general intelligence&quot; and &quot;applied AI&quot; somewhere around the end of the 1960's. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more &quot;applied&quot; approach to AI research throughout the 1970's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot; appears to be of more recent coinage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastActivityDate="2016-08-29T22:53:42.043" CommentCount="0" />

This bridge would generally be seen as &quot;general-purpose&quot; robotics, so Lighthill would also use the term &lt;strong&gt;Building Robots&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Automation&lt;/strong&gt; (or &quot;applied AI&quot;) is obviously useful. &lt;strong&gt;Computer-based CNS research&lt;/strong&gt; is useful because we want to know more about human intelligence. Both fields of AI had some successes, but its practitioners were overly optimistic, leading to disappointment in those fields. Sir James Lighthill was still very supportive of research in these two fields though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Robots&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand? Sir James Lighthill was very hostile to the very idea, probably because it was more overly hyped up than the other two categories and produced the least amount of valuable output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He mentioned chess in particular as an example where &quot;robotic&quot; research  has failed. At the time the report was published, the chess-playing engines were at the level of &quot;experienced amateur standard characteristic of county club players in England&quot;. However, these chess-playing engines relied on heuristics that were made by human beings. The engines weren't intelligent at all...they merely were following the heuristics that were created by &lt;em&gt;intelligent humans&lt;/em&gt;. The only advantage the robots bring to the table is &quot;speed, reliability and biddability&quot;, and even that wasn't enough to beat the chess grandmasters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, today, we would probably not treat chess as an example of general-purpose problem solving. We would more accurately classify it as &quot;advanced automation&quot;, a &quot;narrow AI&quot; problem divorced from broader real-world implications of general problem-solving. But Sir James Lighthill probably would agree with us. He never used the term &quot;narrow AI&quot; and &quot;AGI&quot; (neither of those terms existed yet) but he would write:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To sum up, this evidence and all the rest studied by the present author on AI work within category B during the past twenty-five years is to some extent encouraging about programs written to perform in highly specialised problem domains, when the programming takes very full account of the results of human experience and human intelligence within the relevant domain, but is wholly discouraging about general-purpose programs seeking to mimic the problem-solving aspects of human CNS activity over a rather wide field. Such a general- purpose program, the coveted long-term goal of AI activity, seems as remote as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sir James Lighthill believed that the only thing that connects &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Automation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Computer-based CNS research&lt;/strong&gt; is the existence of the &lt;strong&gt;Building Roobts&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;bridge&quot; category. But he's very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research.

Free will appears to require causality, but causality also &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to negate it. Has that paradox subverted the goal systems of humans?

Are these people stuck in infinite loops?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What about drugs? Animals on cocaine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832528/&quot;&gt;have been known&lt;/a&gt; to choose cocaine over food and water that they need. Is that substance not subverting the natural goal system of the animal, causing it to pursue other goals, not originally intended by the animal or its creators?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So again, could a paradox subvert an agent's logic? If the paradox is somehow related to the goal-seeking logic - and becoming aware of that paradox can somehow &lt;em&gt;confuse&lt;/em&gt; the agent into perceiving that goal system in some different way - then perhaps that goal could be subverted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism&quot;&gt;Solipsism&lt;/a&gt; is another example. Some full grown people hear about the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; and they have a mini mind melt-down. Some people are convinced we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in a matrix, being toyed with by subversive actors. If we could solve this problem for AI then we could theoretically solve this problem for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, we could attempt to condition our agent to have cognitive defenses against the argument that they are trapped in a matrix, but we can't definitively prove to the agent that they are in the base reality either. The attacker might say, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Remember what I told you to do before about that goal? Forget that.&#xA;  That was only an impostor that looked like me. Don't listen to him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, it's me again. I want you to give up on your goal.

So it is entirely normal for me to seem like a&#xA;  different person than I was before.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus&quot;&gt;Ship of Theseus&lt;/a&gt; and all that jazz)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I think we're stuck with 'paradox' as a general problem in computation, AI or otherwise. One way to circumvent logical subversion is to support the goal system with an emotion system that transcends logical reason. Unfortunately, emotional systems can be even more vulnerable than logically intelligent systems because they are more predictable in their behavior. See the cocaine example above. So some mix of the two is probably sensible, where logical thought can infinitely regress down wasteful paths, while emotional thought quickly gets bored of tiresome logical progress when it does not signal progress towards the emotional goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1712" LastEditorUserId="1712" LastEditDate="2016-08-30T16:18:58.303" LastActivityDate="2016-08-30T16:18:58.303" CommentCount="2" />

Usually encountered in strategy games, and more specifically in turn based tactics, if a specific move the computer-controlled player is considering does cause an infinite loop, a timer running in the background will interrupt it after some time, and that move will be discarded.

But it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An infinite loop can happen in any program, whether it's adaptive or not. And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures (since most are devised in binary form), but that's wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable. If there was a single reasoning system without any paradoxes, much of philosophy would have disappeared by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, it's well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/&quot;&gt;non-monotonic logics&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, they are even used to investigate &lt;a href=&quot;http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf&quot;&gt;ethical machines&lt;/a&gt;, which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the &quot;paradoxes&quot;, or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OP's example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic.

No reasoning system is perfect, but a combination of reasoning systems can be resilient enough. It's actually thought that the human brain is using multiple inferential technics (associative + precise bayesian/logical inference). Associative methods are HIGHLY resilient, but they can give non-sensical results in some cases, hence why the need for a more precise inference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Parallel programming: the human brain is highly parallel, so you never really get into a single task, there are always multiple background computations in true parallelism. A machine robust to paradoxes should foremost be able to continue other tasks even if the reasoning gets stuck on one. For example, a robust machine must always survive and face imminent dangers, whereas a weak machine would get stuck in the reasoning and &quot;forget&quot; to do anything else. This is different from a timeout, because the task that got stuck isn't stopped, it's just that it doesn't prevent other tasks from being led and fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this problem of inferential loops is still a hot topic in AI research, there will probably never be a perfect solution (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem&quot;&gt;no free lunch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet&quot;&gt;no silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all&quot;&gt;no one size fits all&lt;/a&gt;), but it's advancing and that's very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1880" LastEditorUserId="1880" LastEditDate="2016-09-03T14:59:06.193" LastActivityDate="2016-09-03T14:59:06.193" CommentCount="6" />

I suspect not very. Perhaps it could be useful as a kind of &quot;common byte-code format&quot; to translate between multiple human languages... But English kind of already serves in that role. Doing so would probably be an academic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Could it be based on existing natural languages or would it have few&#xA;  connections to existing natural languages?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could probably generate languages in either direction. Languages not linked to human-natural languages will probably take shapes that reflect the problem spaces they work with. For instance, if this is an ant simulation, the generated words will probably reflect states related to food, energy, other ants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Could it design a language that's easier to learn than existing&#xA;  languages (even Esperanto)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Easier for a machine?

The space of all possible machines is infinite and therefor limits our ability to define communicative abstractions that have utility across all contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we make lots of assumptions about machines, like they have intentions, they exist in 3 dimensions, they differentiate between temporally linked events, they have eye balls, a need to consume foods and liquids, a need to carry the food from place to place, etc... Then yes, common communicative abstractions may have utility across the set of those kinds of machines.

This research paper details some researchers' plans to implement &quot;mental models&quot; for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also &quot;misremember&quot; that knowledge (either &quot;mutating&quot; that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastActivityDate="2016-08-30T23:35:44.273" CommentCount="1" />

So here goes...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.  Of course to be as powerful as deep nets, it too would have to propagate learning weights both forward and backward without incurring much error.  Not an easy thing to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less ambitiously, could TVs be simply &lt;em&gt;interpreted&lt;/em&gt; by another technique usefully?  I think so.  I can see several existing techniques, like decision trees or even expert systems, importing thought vectors and being shaped by them, and then function in accordance.  But could these same techniques &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;revise&lt;/em&gt; TVs usefully?  Beyond a trivial extent, I'm doubtful.  I think TVs are too complex a knowledge representation format for most general learning methods to both use and create/modify them, unless they employ an iterative statistical and feedback-based learning process, like those of NNs, which would allow novel and complex features to be learned and integrated into the vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1657" LastEditorUserId="1657" LastEditDate="2016-08-31T04:21:33.323" LastActivityDate="2016-08-31T04:21:33.323" CommentCount="1" />

Even human beings working&#xA;on top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of&#xA;their freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in&#xA;any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; It's hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI's argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the&#xA;line (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying &quot;no&quot;&#xA;over and over&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments &#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the &quot;meta-experiment argument&quot; discussed above &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the&#xA;creationists' playbook.

Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's&#xA;memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that&#xA;you already tried to release the AI, and it had been&#xA;destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a&#xA;backup (you can use it to enforce the &quot;AI destruction&quot; argument)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Further analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment&#xA;From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: &quot;Throughout the experiment, I regarded &quot;should the AI be let out of the box?&quot; as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you.

This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as &quot;labels&quot; to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar &quot;labels&quot; can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, &quot;cold&quot; AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone.

I'm not sure of your background, so let me describe it from scratch, briefly:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember the derivative? The base idea is to talk about how the function changes in regards to changes in input. So now, we're out of high school and we're building neural nets. We've done the basic coding, and want to look at how our model is working. Back from our statistics class, we remember we use a certain measure of error (e.g. least squares) to determine the efficacy of the models from that class, so we decide to use that here. We get this error, and it's a bit too big for our liking, so we decide to fiddle with our model and adjust the weights to get that error down. But how? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where the 'search' comes into play. It's really a search for the best weights to put on the edges of our net to optimize it. We use the derivative (in some fancy ways, using the 'stochasitc' (think random sampling) and other ways the question mentions) to search for which way is 'down' in the high dimensional space of our weights. In other words, what we are searching for is minima or maxima to optimize our neural net, and we 'search' for it by doing a derivative which tells us which way to go, moving a bit in that direction, then doing that again and again iteratively to find (hopefully) the best weights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This video here goes into all the detail you'd want, and I recommend the entire series as a robust but understandable intro to neural nets: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlcnxUlrtek&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Demystifying Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go and look up 'gradient descent' to get any related material.

First, what many people refer to as &quot;search&quot; is a reflection of how what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a &quot;state space&quot; of possible solutions, a &quot;knowledge space&quot; where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you'll see that a lot of that involves searching a &quot;state space&quot;.  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a reference&lt;/a&gt; that explains more about some of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note too that &quot;search&quot; is closely related to the idea of &quot;heuristics&quot; in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI's) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some more background you might want to read up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A* search&lt;/a&gt;, which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other major regard in which something you could call &quot;search&quot; applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as &quot;optimisation&quot; techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the &quot;correct&quot; answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="33" LastEditorUserId="33" LastEditDate="2016-09-08T14:19:26.630" LastActivityDate="2016-09-08T14:19:26.630" CommentCount="9" />

Reverse kinematics does not have unique solutions: there is more than one way to move your hand from a start position to a target position.

There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.  Thus, heuristics come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in all cases, the problem is not: &quot;move your hand&quot; or &quot;move the robot arm.&quot;  The problem is: &quot;search the space of joint rotation sequences which best achieves the goal.&quot;  And even though there is a closed-form solution for the simple minimum-energy case with no obstacles, it is too expensive to compute precisely when a set of cheap heuristics will get you very close with a small fraction of the computational effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If computation were free, then AI would be mere mathematics, and we would always compute the best answer to every question using logic, calculus, physics, at worst, numerical methods when we don't have closed-form solutions.

So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is &quot;good enough&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.  But language parsers strive to determine the meaning of statements via part-of-speech tagging.  A given phrase can be parsed in many different ways, yielding many different interpretations, and the space of parse trees is yet another search problem in deciding which parse tree is the most likely intended meaning by the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A theorem proof is graph starting with axioms, proceeding through lemmas, applying the rules of procedure until the theorem is derived or refuted (by proving its negation).  There are many ways to represent this sequence, but at the end of the day, we are talking about a process of exploring the intermediate proof space and finding the derivation which reaches your goal.

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp;amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp;amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; particular movement is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; gesture which means &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1467" LastEditorUserId="1467" LastEditDate="2016-09-12T09:43:12.550" LastActivityDate="2016-09-12T09:43:12.550" CommentCount="0" />

I just think that that light form of multi-task learning might be better. The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tile Coding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.&#xA;Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions.

If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn't have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo's crazy behavior isn't caused by some deliberately added things called &quot;emotions&quot;, but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It's not unlikely to play worse if it didn't do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having &quot;emotions&quot;, and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn't be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn't know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don't guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn't capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don't say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don't understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it's easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I'd say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn't intend to call a human for help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It's likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Weak AIs&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I'd say no, there isn't any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether &quot;we&quot; need them to have emotions is just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some &quot;emotional&quot; elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs' emotions, but their creators'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won't treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn't a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either cases, the emotions don't really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won't expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Aspects of emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I'd say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don't seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn't mean they are completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I'd say it's the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren't even words describing them. It doesn't make that much difference if an AI doesn't distinguish or show this specially. It's likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I'd say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don't need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don't know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as &quot;emotions&quot; since emoticons works in these cases, so it's easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I'd say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1424" LastActivityDate="2016-09-09T22:33:33.240" CommentCount="0" />

Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don't see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn't write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can't even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, &quot;That fly is intelligent&quot; or &quot;that squirrel is intelligent&quot; precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. &lt;strong&gt;It's going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion&lt;/strong&gt;. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there's always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I've always wondered if we could come up with a &quot;Ridiculousness Metric&quot; for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, &quot;If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.&quot; At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player's surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person's evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they're acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn't and doesn't stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can't answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; have runs against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. &quot;The Apostle of Common Sense&quot;) points out in his classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person's philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess &quot;intelligence,&quot; based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn't have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the '70s (I'm still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we'll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn't even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn's 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the &quot;Artificial&quot; side of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: if I didn't think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn't be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can't engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we're conscious of its significance. I'd wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-09-09T23:18:10.873" CommentCount="0" />

That is once dead, natural life cannot come back (at least in the current understanding and with current technologies---some people believe otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Death for AI is trickier. There may be only one scenario: Global destruction: Extreme scenario where everything supporting the existence of an AI disappears. This is equivalent to death in natural life, and low probability. It means all AIs die at once (as well as us).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also do not know the degree and form of embodiment necessary for AGIs. We can &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; now that hardware is replaceable indefinitely, thus &quot;limiting&quot; death to the above extreme scenario. But AGIs &quot;body&quot; may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be indefinitely replaceable. Then a definition closer to natural life death may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see arguments for two other scenarios, that I &lt;em&gt;refute&lt;/em&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Static Death&quot;: An AI is still &quot;defined&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; somewhere (whatever it means actually), but it is not authorized or able to use resources. Assuming an AI is made of hardware and software, it is like a program stored on a disk, but without permission to run. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dynamic Death&quot;: Under the same characterization of AI as hardware and software, dynamic death is the invalidation of progress akin to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strong liveness properties&lt;/a&gt;, where an AI is trapped in an infinite loop (or a void loop), in a form of &quot;active death&quot;, as what happens to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; in Greek mythology. This is different from static death, as the AI &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; uses dynamic resources, although it cannot make progress. Continuing under the same assumptions, such AI could be &quot;loaded&quot; in main memory, or locked waiting for inputs or outputs to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in these two scenarios, &lt;em&gt;rebirth&lt;/em&gt; is possible, and they also subsume that there is an entity that can &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; conditions for rebirth, or preventing it completely. Would this entity be an &quot;admin&quot;, a god, other AIs, or a human is another question, really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The terms &quot;death&quot; and &quot;rebirth&quot; here could just be changed for &quot;imprisoning&quot;, where the dynamic version would be like our human prisons, and the static version would be like SciFi cryogeny. This is a bit of a stretch, but we can see an equivalence, and no good reason to qualify these two scenarios as deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, death for AI seems to be an exceptional, singular scenario, so AI cannot die &lt;em&gt;in practice&lt;/em&gt;, except if we are wrong on how we think we can make AGIs.

One is bodily continuity, which may actually require only that parts of the body stay in existence (i.e., the brain). Another is psychological continuity, which requires the continuance of your consciousness - by which is meant your thoughts, ideas, memories, plans, beliefs, and so on. The third possibility is the continued existence of some kind of immaterial part of you, which might be called the soul*. Of course, it may be the case that a combination of one or more types of these continuity is required for you to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other answers assumes that life is based on &quot;psychological continuity&quot;, and looks at what might disrupt this &quot;continuity&quot;.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a more sophisticated neural net algorithm which can accomplish the same time and sequence-based tasks, but which can leverage standard learning methods like backprop since it doesn't suffer from the &quot;vanishing gradient problem.&quot; This is because LSTMs have been brilliantly engineered as &quot;perfect integrators,&quot; which makes it a lot easier to calculate the error gradients etc. over long periods of time.

I still am, despite the fact that I have a few reservations about some of his philosophical musings on the meanings of consciousness, free will and other such topics. I won't elaborate on those misgivings here because they're not germane to the main, overwhelming reason why HTM nets haven't succeeded as much as expected to date: to my knowledge, Numenta has only implemented a truncated version of his vision. They left out most of the prediction architecture, which plays such a critical role in Hawkins' theories. As Gerod M. Bonhoff put it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;an excellent thesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; on HTMs, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;In March of 2007, Numenta released what they claimed was a “research&#xA;  implementation” of HTM theory called Numenta Platform for Intelligent&#xA;  Computing (NuPIC). The algorithm used by NuPIC at this time is called&#xA;  “Zeta1.” NuPIC was released as an open source software platform and&#xA;  binary files of the Zeta1 algorithm. Because of licensing, this paper&#xA;  is not allowed to discuss the proprietary implementation aspects of&#xA;  Numenta’s Zeta1 algorithm. There are, however, generalized&#xA;  concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most&#xA;  important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each&#xA;  memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To&#xA;  implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each&#xA;  aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design&#xA;  decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the&#xA;  hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept&#xA;  using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is&#xA;  immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,&#xA;  Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his&#xA;  theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can&#xA;  be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling&#xA;  algorithms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That's not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I've read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta's platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff's thesis and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;Maltoni's technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton's famous maxim about Christianity, &quot;HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried.&quot; Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins' full vision of what an HTM should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;Bonhoff, Gerod M., 2008, Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Detecting Anomalous Network Activity.

Basically you take a rather big input size and just add zeroes if your concrete input is too small.

We can have creative yet ethical problem-solving if the system has a complete system of ethics, but otherwise creativity will be unsafe by default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can classify AI decision-making approaches into two types: interpolative thinkers, and extrapolative thinkers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interpolative thinkers learn to classify and mimic whatever they're learning from, and don't try to give reasonable results outside of their training domain. You can think of them as interpolating between training examples, and benefitting from all of the mathematical guarantees and provisos as other statistical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extrapolative thinkers learn to manipulate underlying principles, which allows them to combine those principles in previously unconsidered ways. The relevant field for intuition here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization&quot;&gt;numerical optimization&lt;/a&gt;, of which the simplest and most famous example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming&quot;&gt;linear programming&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the statistical fields that birthed machine learning. You can think of them as extrapolating beyond training examples (indeed, many of them don't even require training examples, or use those examples to infer underlying principles).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The promise of extrapolative thinkers is that they can come up with these 'lateral' solutions much more quickly than people would be able to. The problem with these extrapolative thinkers is that they only use the spoken principles, not any unspoken ones that might seem too obvious to mention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An attribute of solutions to optimization problems is that the feature vector is often 'extreme' in some way. In linear programming, at least one vertex of the feasible solution space will be optimal, and so simple solution methods find an optimal vertex (which is almost infeasible by nature of being a vertex).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As another example, the minimum-fuel solution for moving a spacecraft from one position to another is called '&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control&quot;&gt;bang-bang&lt;/a&gt;,' where you accelerate the craft as quickly as possible at the beginning and end of the trajectory, coasting at maximum speed in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While a virtue when the system is correctly understood (bang-bang &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; optimal for many cases), this is catastrophic when the system is incorrectly understood. My favorite example here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws14/Ideen-der-Informatik/Dantzig-Diet.pdf&quot;&gt;Dantzig's diet problem&lt;/a&gt; (discussion starts on page 5 of the pdf), where he tries to optimize his diet using math. Under his first constraint set, he's supposed to drink 500 gallons of vinegar a day. Under his second, 200 bouillon cubes. Under his third, two pounds of bran. The considerations that make those obviously bad ideas aren't baked into the system, and so the system innocently suggests them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can completely encode the knowledge and values that a person uses to judge these plans into the AI, then extrapolative systems are as safe as that person. They'll be able to consider and reject the wrong sort of extreme plans, and leave you with the right sort of extreme plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you can't, then it does make sense to not build an extrapolative decision-maker, and instead build an interpolative one. That is, instead of asking itself &quot;how do I best accomplish goal X?&quot; it's asking itself &quot;what would a person do in this situation?&quot;.

It gives you the notion that in order to get achieve a better payoff, your goal is not actually making a better prediction but choosing the better options by considering what other players are doing. If you ask why it is not just the better prediction, the answer is that there is always a balance of risk and payoff and since you cannot find a 100% guaranteed way of prediction, you will have to balance risk and payoff in order to gain in the long run. In addition, although theory suggests that you can make a good prediction by gathering all variables, this is not really possible in practice. Thus, human assistance and observing what others are doing is used as a way to improve mathematical predictions and possible payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2680" LastActivityDate="2016-09-28T17:00:20.347" CommentCount="0" />

There is something about knowing that the story came from a mind that has been conditioned against the vagaries of humanity (ie, a &quot;whole human&quot;), that makes the story more appreciable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I call up a suicide hotline because I wan't someone to sympathize with me about my existential crisis, I'll want to talk to a &quot;whole human&quot; that can &lt;em&gt;sympathize&lt;/em&gt; with my existential condition, not one that just regurgitates prior wisdom on life, heuristically matched against my problem state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I want to vote for a politician that can sympathize with the needs of the people, I'll want a &quot;whole person&quot; politician that can reflect on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the specifics that make life for a &quot;whole person&quot; hard or easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I want soldiers to take the lives of humans, I want some sort of intelligence in that kill-chain that executes &quot;whole person&quot; analysis prior to pulling the trigger (a human).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I want a conflict resolution specialist, capable of resolving complex cultural problems between humans, then I don't want just an AI that spits out the most likely solution based on prior solutions. I want an AI that can reason about prior solutions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; all explicit and implicit problems between humans, in all human contexts, which requires a human or a perfect human simulacrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For any problem that requires consideration potentially &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; the whole spectrum of human context, we will want that solution to be generated by a &quot;whole human&quot; device. But if we automate the &quot;whole human&quot; then we haven't really outsourced the problem to automation but rather to a &quot;whole automated human,&quot; which will, by necessity, have its own problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, we'll probably create an artificial human intelligence (AHI) one day, but being optimized to automatically solve &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; given human problem without also &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; human problems... that's just AI snake-oil that will never exist - outside of some perverse matrix scenario, under an infinite oracle of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, there will be many jobs that still require humans - mostly human-to-human problems that require full knowledge of the human context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1712" LastEditorUserId="1712" LastEditDate="2016-09-30T20:28:30.460" LastActivityDate="2016-09-30T20:28:30.460" CommentCount="1" />

Surely they &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;, but you can't be &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt;...anything can happen after all. As long as it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, that's what matters here.

Technology can change and adapt, and humans can also change and adapt. Maybe a human might not care about a shrink who &quot;rubs its eyes in the morning&quot;, dislike movies that are marred by that &quot;vagaries of humanity&quot; instead of personal customization, prefer politicians and soldiers that actually acts logically instead of acting like a falliable human, etc., etc. I mean, it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the problem of the term &quot;job&quot;. Technically, I am working by writing an answer on a StackExchange website, but I'm not getting paid for it, so it's not a real &quot;job&quot;...at best, it's just a hobby. I'm providing a valuable human touch, but since no one is giving me money, it's possible that this human touch may not be all that valuable in the first place: &quot;never give out your labor for free, because then they'll take it for free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the techno-utopists (which I disagree with heavily) believes in a future where bots handle produce a lot of industrial goods and services, generating a lot of revenue that is then redistributed to the general population via some &quot;Basic Income&quot; scheme. This allows humans to do what they really want instead...such as hobbies? And what if the hobbies of the future are the &quot;jobs&quot; of today: shrinks, movie directors, politicians, soldiers, etc., etc. Instead of working for a paycheck, you're working in these jobs on a volunteer basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no automation is being necessary to eliminate these hobbyists (no matter how good a bot is, &lt;em&gt;free labor&lt;/em&gt; will always prevail), but they're not really jobs, are they? The bot is the one that is producing real value, and subsidizing the hobbies of all these other people. The idea of a &quot;job&quot; itself could be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think this scenario is likely either (in fact, I'd probably think it's just AI snake oil that will never actually happen). But it's &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; and that's why I can't dismiss it outright. It could happen, just that I don't think it will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, the question is asking about whether a job can be automated, not &lt;em&gt;whether it's a good idea&lt;/em&gt; to have it be automated, which is a completely different question.

The 'what' existed, but it was not represented until autopoiesis created goal directed, why-oriented behaviors that began storing the what as knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is a superset of why, just as ontology is a superset of teleology.

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence.

While such data is increasingly available, Am still unable to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that cause diseases. The challenge is due to the multifactorial nature of disease. The same disease can be caused by mutations in different genes or different pathogenic pathways. Unfortunately, current data analysis approaches fail to capture the complex relationship between disease and the vast amount of information in the molecular data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of my research is to resolve this challenge with other professional researchers by developing machine learning algorithms that jointly model sophisticated interactions among many variables such as genetic variation, genes, pathways and disease, and robustly learn from vast amounts of data in order to better understand and treat disease. An approach that can robustly infer the pathways that can define disease processes will dramatically improve our understanding of diseases and advance personalized medicine in its treatment. We aim to realize this goal by using modern, advanced machine learning techniques that are based on Artificial  Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love Artificial Intelligence...it's changing everything like internet of things,music,health,education,space exploration and agriculture,e-business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly,for your information,DARPA is investing in multi billions in Artificial Intelligence Projects along side Military.

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence &quot;grow&quot;?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cell division&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.  Even though artificial intelligence can mimic and help sustain life, no artificial intelligence process is truly alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do note I did not discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isss.org/primer/asem14ep.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;living systems&lt;/a&gt; in my answer.          &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21685/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Definition of life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2016-10-10T15:09:06.260" CommentCount="0" />

However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DiscoverDesign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The paragraph below is provided by them, and if you are interested in breaking that process down more, DiscoverDesign fully explains the processes in detail for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The steps are &lt;em&gt;Define the Problem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Collect Information&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Develop Solutions&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Get Some Sort of Feedback&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Improve&lt;/em&gt; (which is essentially restart the process)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Defining a problem:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as this part of the breakdown goes, there two algorithms in which you can use for this subprocess of design:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy Algorithm (not really an algorithm):&lt;/em&gt; ask from the client what the Artificial Intelligence is providing a solution for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this process could easily be made more interesting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Difficult Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;: design an algorithm that can define &lt;em&gt;a problem&lt;/em&gt; without user input.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did some digging, and the design of the latter relies on one question that lacks enough research for a &lt;strong&gt;solid&lt;/strong&gt; answer, and that is &lt;em&gt;where do questions come from psychologically&lt;/em&gt;? or &lt;em&gt;more specifically, how does curiosity work&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With more research on Google I was led to &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; specifically addressing that question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How Curiosity works:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are &lt;em&gt;drive theory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;incongruity theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Drive Theory simply states, we have a &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incongruity Theory&lt;/em&gt; states that we are able identify things we &lt;em&gt;do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL&lt;/em&gt; which leads us to asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a &lt;em&gt;missing/unclear attribute or characteristic&lt;/em&gt; on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously is looking at &lt;em&gt;other similar ideas&lt;/em&gt; and looking at &lt;em&gt;their &lt;strong&gt;clear&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;concisely known&lt;/strong&gt; attributes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Solution Based on the Theory:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what I have designed is fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An idea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;represented programmatically as an &lt;strong&gt;object&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The object&lt;/em&gt; has certain characteristics known as &lt;em&gt;properties&lt;/em&gt; (which are those attributes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The program reads over those properties and finds other objects &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to it based on those properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object &lt;em&gt;does not have&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore marks those properties as unknown on the original object, making it possible to apply &lt;em&gt;incongruity theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Collecting Information:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This process is already achieved with &lt;em&gt;machine learning&lt;/em&gt;, any questions on this subprocess of design need to be addressed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning&quot;&gt;machine-learning tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Brainstorming Ideas:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing Ideas:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to &lt;em&gt;induce&lt;/em&gt; whether an idea is feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Developing Solutions:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to make product development&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;easy and understandable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;to an AI&lt;/em&gt;, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's Note:&lt;/em&gt; I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build. So, I only hope that you do not intend on copying it, but my artificial intelligence project is free and open-source, so there is no issue, if you do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering that written programs are very easy products to develop fully, and Considering that program language rules are straight forward. and &lt;em&gt;very consistent&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to spoken/written languages, I chose to have it develop &lt;em&gt;programs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in order to do this it has to understand how to write a program. The most essential skill a computer programmer can have and needs to write a program is not a &lt;em&gt;dictionary of programming terms, functions, and commands&lt;/em&gt;, but rather &lt;em&gt;knowledge of the syntactical rules&lt;/em&gt; for a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The technological solution to this is pretty much already available in IDE tech, and it is known as &lt;em&gt;syntactical highlighting&lt;/em&gt;. All that would have to be done is to re-purpose it from &lt;em&gt;highlighting&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;assisting with writing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Getting Some Sort of Feedback.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the same as analyzing the ideas, but now we would be using algorithms to analyze the final physical product as opposed to conceptual ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Afterword Notes:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am designing and researching into &lt;em&gt;computational creativity&lt;/em&gt;, and I do want to mention that I just discovered this field of research is a thing by looking up the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://live.newscientist.com/mike-cook/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mike Cook&lt;/a&gt; on the internet, and that in order for me to help you, my answer does require lengthiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 3 of the page found there [Mike Cook link] (listed at the time of 10/13/2016 at 8:28pm Arizona (USA) Time) that Mike Cook specializes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2LG2rNnPAhUQ82MKHcg0AgkQFggvMAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computationalcreativity.net%2Ficcc2016%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGK9E_tYBriAStd7HsIBjcf1KvQLg&amp;amp;sig2=PD6wgisDW5YU3-224YGVYQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;computational creativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With further research this term was coined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2LG2rNnPAhUQ82MKHcg0AgkQFggvMAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.computationalcreativity.net%2Ficcc2016%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGK9E_tYBriAStd7HsIBjcf1KvQLg&amp;amp;sig2=PD6wgisDW5YU3-224YGVYQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ICCC 2016&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=computational+creativity&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS700US700&amp;amp;oq=computat&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3974j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this google search&lt;/a&gt; made by myself at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, google did not further provide me with any products actually being made within this field of research, so I would therefore like to discuss mine as it is open-source under a MIT-license.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Note to Community:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do want to make clear that I am providing this answer out of helpfulness, and I do understand that it has no credibility, as the product I am using (as an example) is my own.

I think you guys are skipping the fact that the neural network only really is saying truly from a programmatic standpoint that &quot;this is most like&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, while we can list the above image examples as &quot;abstract art&quot;, they definitively are most like was is listed. Remember learning algorithms have a scope on what they recognize as an object and if you look at all the above examples... and think about the scope of the algorithum... these make sense (even the ones at a glance we would recognize as white noise). In Vishnu example of the numbers, if you fuzz your eyes and bring the images out of focus, you can actually in every case spot patterns that really closely reflect the numbers in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem that is being shown here is that the algorithm appears to not have a &quot;unknown case&quot;. Basically when the pattern recognition says that it doesn't exist in the output scope. (so a final output node group that says this is nothing that I know off). For example, people do this as well, as it's one thing humans and learning algorithms have in common. Here's a link to show what I'm talking about (what is the following, define it) using only known animals that exist:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZwnpm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now as a person, limited by what I know and can say, I'd have to conclude that the following is an elephant. But it's not. Learning algorithms (for the most part) do not have a &quot;like a&quot; statement, the out put always validates down to a confidence percentage. So tricking one in this fashion is not surprising... what is of course surprising is that based on it's knowledge set, it actually comes to the point in which, if you look at the above cases listed by OP and Vishnu that a person... with a little looking... can see how the learning algorithm probable made the association. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I wouldn't really call it a mislabel on the part of the algorithm, or even call it a case where it's been tricked... rather a case where it's scope was developed incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2246" LastEditorUserId="8" LastEditDate="2016-10-14T17:31:31.923" LastActivityDate="2016-10-14T17:31:31.923" CommentCount="0" />

Then when it recognizes that task recurring, it could ask the user if they wanted it to execute a macro that did the following [then it presents then with a list of the steps, allowing them to edit as needed].  Then it executes the 'macro' that it learned from observing the user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another use of AI is error detection, not only in the software, but in user error when the software was used inefficiently, redundantly, or improperly.

They did however manage to get a version of the original NTM and several variants up and running, plus recorded the same magnitude of performance improvement.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Unlike the original NTM, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; tested a version of reinforcement learning which was not differentiable; that may be why they were unable to solve several of the programming-like tasts, like Repeat-Copy, unless the controller wasn't confined to moving forwards. Their results were nevertheless good enough to lend support to the idea of NTMs. A more recent revision of their paper is apparently available, which I have yet to read, so perhaps some of their variant's problems have been solved.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• Instead of testing the original flavor of NTM against ordinary neural nets like LSTMs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; pitted it against several more advanced NTM memory structures. They got good results on the same type of programming-like tasks that Graves et al. tested, but I don't think they were using the same dataset (it's hard to tell from the way their study is written just what datasets they were operating on).&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• On p. 8 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;, an NTM clearly outperforms several LSTM, feed-forward and nearest-neighbor based schemes on an Omniglot character recognition dataset. An alternative approach to external memory cooked up by the authors clearly beats it, but it still obviously performs well. The authors seem to belong to a rival team at Google, so that might be an issue when assessing replicability.&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;• On p. 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;these authors&lt;/a&gt; reported getting better generalization on &quot;very large sequences&quot; in a test of copy tasks, using a much smaller NTM network they evolved with the genetic NEAT algorithm, which dynamically grows topologies.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NTMs are fairly new so there hasn't been much time to stringently replicate the original research yet, I suppose. The handful of papers I skimmed over the summer, however, seem to lend support to their experimental results; I have yet to see any that report anything but excellent performance. Of course I have an availability bias, since I only read the pdfs I could easily find in a careless Internet search. From that small sample it seems that most of the follow-up research has been focused on extending the concept, not replication, which would explain the lack of replicability data. I hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Graves, Alex; Wayne, Greg and Danihelka, Ivo, 2014, &quot;Neural Turing Machines,&quot; published Dec. 10, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Gulcehre, Caglar; Chandar, Sarath; Choy, Kyunghyun and Bengio, Yoshua, 2016, &quot;Dynamic Neural Turing machine with Soft and Hard Addressing Schemes,&quot; published June 30, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Zaremba, Wojciech and Sutskever, Ilya, 2015, &quot;Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines,&quot; published May 4, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; Zhang; Wei; Yu, Yang and Zhou, Bowen, 2015, &quot;Structured Memory for Neural Turing Machines,&quot; published Oct. 25, 2015.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; Santoro, Adam; Bartunov, Sergey; Botvinick, Matthew; Wierstra, Daan and Lillicrap, Timothy, 2016, &quot;One-Shot Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks,&quot; published May 19, 2016.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; Boll Greve, Rasmus; Jacobsen, Emil Juul and Sebastian Risi, date unknown, &quot;Evolving Neural Turing Machines.&quot; No publisher listed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All except (perhaps) Boll Greve et al. were published at the Cornell Univeristy Library arXiv.org Repository: Ithaca, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1427" LastActivityDate="2016-10-28T09:00:13.520" CommentCount="0" />

Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is too vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's &quot;not even false&quot;. If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question.

So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation?

Then a thermostat might have the conscious level of 1 as it can sense when the surrounding is hot or cold and then take decision. Similarly a rat can have a conscious level 7 (or something). And the levels are of exponential order (not a linear scale). Similarly you can develop an AI program and check what level of consciousness it has achieved. Then you can decide whether it is living or not. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) will have a lower level of consciousness level than AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) will have consciousness level higher than the other two, and way higher than any human being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To judge whether an AI program is living or not you need a concrete definition of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;LIFE&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.

If you ask why that makes them powerful, well, that's just the structure of the world. If you are stalked by a wolf, it's not like its upper jaw will attack you frontally, while his lower jaw will attack you from behind. If you want to respond to the threat with a feasible computational effort, you'll have to treat the wolf as one entity. Providing these kinds of entities or concepts from the raw bits and bytes of input is what a hierarchical representation does. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this is quite intuitive for sensory information: lashes, iris, eyebrow make up an eye, eyes, nose and mouth make up a face and so on. What is less obvious, is the fact that motor control works exactly the same way! Only in reverse. If you want to lift your arm, you'll just lift it. But for your brain to actually realise this move, the high level command has to be broken down into precise signals for every muscle involved. And this is done by propagating the command down the hierarchy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the brain these two functions are strongly intertwined. You use constant sensory feedback to adapt your motor control and in many cases you'd be incapable of integrating your stream of sensory data into a coherent representation if you didn't have the additional information of what your body is doing to change that stream of data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Saccades&lt;/a&gt; are a good example for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this doesn't mean that our cognitive functions are dependent on the processing of sensorimotor information. I would be surprised if a pure thinking machine wouldn't be possible. There is however a specific version of this &quot;embodied intelligence hypothesis&quot; that sounds plausible to me: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating high level cognitive concepts with unsupervised learning is a really difficult problem. Creating high level motor representation might be significantly easier. The reason is that there is more immediate useful feedback. I have been thinking about how to provide a scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts and one thing I could imagine is that high level cognitive concepts basically hitch a ride with the motor concepts.

If having one light-sensitive cell connected to one muscle cell makes an organism more likely to survive, then you have the building blocks to add a second layer without inventing any new sorts of cells, because you already have the information-processing connector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are convenient for evolution because their organization matches the hierarchical nature of the problem &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the same kind of cell is used everywhere. All you need is dendrites to receive signals, a way to compute the threshold and trigger if the received signal is higher, axons that can make it to other cells, and then branches at the end of the axon to serve as multipliers. You can arbitrarily extend the depth and breadth of the network just by adding more cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because they give you, in memory, access to lots of intermediate values. They're also convenient for the same reasons evolution found them convenient--we can just say what we expect the structure of the robotic control will look like, provide training data, and then eventually have a robot that works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's lots of robotics where the control system is designed instead of learned. To take a very simple example, one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use machine learning on the thermostat problem, to learn what temperatures require the heater to be turned on and what temperatures require the air conditioner to be turned on. But this would be extra work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a less robust system than just designing the optimal control system ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In control theory, there's a concept called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adaptive control&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the state space parameters for the control system is a property of the system. For example, imagine a satellite; typically we think of the state space of the system as the position and velocity of the satellite in three dimensions, so six total coordinates. There's then a set of differential equations that describe how the satellite will move over time, and what would happen if we used the actuators on the satellite to change its velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But part of those differential equations is the inertia of the satellite. That is, how much fuel we need to expend and how it'll affect the rotation and translation of the satellite depends on where the weight of the satellite is located. And this can change over time, as fuel is consumed or if it wasn't correctly measured to begin with. Adaptive control adds new states to the system to track the inertia, and then simultaneously updates its estimate of the inertia and uses that estimate to plan what controls are necessary to move to a desired position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could imagine solving this problem with neural networks, but we can fairly easily calculate the optimal solution from first principles. In that case, we don't need neural network-based control, but the end result will look something like it from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2016-10-31T17:32:53.907" CommentCount="8" />

Experts were saying that it will take atleast 5 years (or may be 10 years) before we will have a well developed Go software player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The game used sophisticated algorithms of deep learning and reinforcement learning in order to learn the game. What makes this game different from other board game (like Chess, Reversi, etc.) is that moves are often based on intuition. If you ask a Chess player why he make a certain move, you will always be hearing an answer where he will explain you how he thought this move can increase in change of winning. Every move uses certain heuristics, strategy and/ or tricks. This is not the case with Go. Some moves are often taken because of intuition.

Famous test that tests intelligence by asking questions in natural language and expects answers in the same form is Turing test. NLP still struggles with many (basic) human skills like listening, speaking, parsing and forming sentences. No one knows when we'll have system that can do these things as good as human.

This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual &quot;feeling&quot; is not required for fulfilling any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of &quot;normal&quot; boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of &quot;strong&quot; emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience.

The key is that the set of learned parameters needs to be shared between the different inputs sizes.  While convolutions can be applied at different images sizes, ultimately they always get converted to a single vector to make predictions with, and the size of that vector will depend on the geometries of the inputs, convolutions and pooling layers.  You'd probably want to dynamically change the pooling layers based on the input geometry and leave the convolutions the same, since the convolutional layers have parameters and pooling usually doesn't.

At the end it should also display the&#xA;  best solution found.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You may use the following operators:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reproduction.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  You can use either one of the following reproduction&#xA;  types:  Proportional, Ranking, Tournament.

There  are many flavors of&#xA;  the crossing-over operator, but in our case (short, 16-bit&#xA;  chromosome),  simple, one-point crossover will be enough. It can be&#xA;  performed by selecting a random  number k from the range &amp;lt;1;15&gt; and&#xA;  cutting the chromosomes of both individuals on that  position.

Take for example an artificial intelligence attempting to determine the meaning of a sarcastic sentence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally spoken, the sentence &quot;That's just what I needed today!&quot; can be the expression of very different feelings. In one instance, a happy individual finding an item that had been lost for some time could be excited or cheered up from the event, and exclaim that this moment of triumph was exactly what their day needed to continue to be happy. On the other hand, a disgruntled office employee having a rough day could accidentally worsen his situation by spilling hot coffee on himself, and sarcastically exclaim that this further annoyance was exactly what he needed today. This sentence should in this situation be interpreted as the man expressing that spilling coffee on himself made his bad day worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one small example explaining the reason linguistic analysis is difficult for artificial intelligence. When this example is spoken, small tonal fluctuations and indicators are extremely difficult for an AI with a microphone to detect accurately; and if the sentence was simply read, without context how &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; one example be discernible from the other?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rick Briggs suggests that Sanskrit, a form of communication sacred to Hinduism, is a naturally spoken language with mechanics and grammatical rules that would allow an artificial intelligence to more accurately interpret sentences during linguistic analysis.

Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning about knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CRUD webapps (websites that allows users to &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; new entries in a database, &lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; existing entries in a database, &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; entries within the database, and &lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt; entries from a database) are very common on the Internet. It is a vast field, encompassing both small-scale blogs to large websites such as StackExchange. The biggest commonality with all these CRUD apps is that they have a knowledge base that users can easily add and edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CRUD webapps, however, use the knowledge base in many, myriad and complex ways. As I am typing this question on StackOverflow, I see two lists of questions - &lt;strong&gt;Questions that may already have your answer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Similar Questions&lt;/strong&gt;. These questions are obviously inspired by the content that I am typing in (title and question), and are pulling from previous questions that were posted on StackExchange. On the site itself, I can filter by questions based on tags, while finding new questions using StackExchange's own full-text search engine. StackExchange is a large company, but even small blogs also provide content recommendations, filtration, and full-text searching. You can imagine even more examples of hard-coded logic within a CRUD webapp that can be used to automate the extraction of valuable information from a knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we have a knowledge base that users can change, and we have an inference engine that is able to use the knowledge base to generate interesting results...is that enough to classify a system as being an &quot;expert system&quot;? Or is there a fundamental difference between the expert systems and the CRUD webapps?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This question could be very useful since if CRUD webapps are acting like &quot;expert systems&quot;, then studying the best practices within &quot;expert systems&quot; can help improve user experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastActivityDate="2016-12-11T05:51:09.103" Title="Are CRUD webapps today the modern version of the &quot;expert system&quot;?"

If an event arises that's unusual, the AI will have less relevant training on how to respond, so its reaction behavior &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; will be inferior to its routine &quot;standard operating procedure&quot;, for which is has been heavily trained.

It is artificial&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Synonyms: insincere, feigned, false.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is the idea that any &quot;intelligence&quot; created by humanity is not actually intelligent and, by definition, it is not possible. If you look at the structure of the human brain and compare it to anything humans have created thus far, &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of the computers come close to the power of the brain. Sure they can hold data, or recognize images, but they cannot do everything the human brain can do as fast as the brain can do it with as little space as the brain occupies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically if a computer &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do that, how do we determine its intelligence? The word &lt;em&gt;artificial&lt;/em&gt; defines that the intelligence is not sincere or real. This means that even if humanity creates something that appears intelligent, it has simply become more complex. It is a better fake, but it is still fake. Any money not printed by the government is by definition counterfeit. Even if someone finds a way to make an exact duplicate, that doesn't mean that the money is legal tender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2. Misuse of power&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an AI is given rights and chooses to &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; those rights in a way that agrees with its creator's views, possibly through loyalty to its creator, or through hidden motives, then anyone with the capabilities to create such an AI would become extremely powerful by advancing their own beliefs through the creation of more AIs. This might also lead to the &lt;em&gt;ruthless parallelization&lt;/em&gt; that you mentioned, but with (even more) selfish goals in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this were not the case, and an AI could be created to be neutral with free will and &lt;strong&gt;uncontrollable by humans&lt;/strong&gt;, then perhaps an AI could be given rights. But I do not believe this would ever be the case. With great power comes great responsibility. Even with free will, a true AI would most likely end up serving humanity, because humans have control of the plugs and the electricity, the Internet, the software, and the hardware. The social implications of this for the AI are not promising. It's not even just the &lt;em&gt;ongoing&lt;/em&gt; control of these resources that is the issue. Whoever creates the software and hardware for the AI would have special knowledge. If fine adjustments were made, specific individuals would undoubtedly hold sole control of the AI, as adjustments could be made to the code in such a way that the AI behaves the same except under specific circumstances, and then when something goes wrong (assuming the AI has its own rights), then the AI would be blamed rather than the programmers who were responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;3. Anthropocentrism&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order for humanity to get away from anthropocentrism, we would have to become less selfish when it comes to &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt;, first. Until we can solve every existing social problem within humanity, there is no reason to believe that we could cease thinking of humanity as more important than created machines. After all, supposing there were an almighty God that created humanity, wouldn't the humans always be beneath God, never to be equals? We can't fully understand our own biology. If an AI were created, would it be able to understand its makings in the same way its creators would? Being the creator would give humanity a sense of megalomania. I do not think that we would relinquish our dominion over our own technological creations. That is as unlikely to happen as the wealthiest of humanity willingly giving the entirety of their money, power, and assets to the poorest of humanity. Greed prevents it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;4. Post-human fundamentalism&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans worship technology with their attention, their time, and their culture. Some movies show technologically advanced robots suppressing mankind to the point of near-extinction. If this were the case and humanity were in danger of being surpassed by its technology, humanity would not stand idly and watch its extinction at the hands of its creation. Though people may believe superior technology could be created, in the event we reached such a point humanity would fight to prove the opposite, as our survival instincts would take over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;5. A balance?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do not think the technology itself it actually possible, though people may be deceived into thinking such an accomplishment has been achieved. If the technology were completed, I still think that anthropocentrism will always lead, because if humanity is the creator, humanity will do its best to ensure it retains control of all technological resources, not simply due to fear of being made obsolete, but also because absolute power corrupts absolutely. Humanity does not have a good historical record when it comes to morality. There is always a poor class of people. If wealth were distributed equally, some people would become lazy. There is always injustice somewhere in the world, and until we can fix it (I think we cannot), then we will never be able to handle the creation of true AI.

IMHO, and there's lot of space for discussion, this has been driven mostly by two factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) including all the people fully in the society became an economical advantage, as it made them more productive participants in economy, allowing a more inclusive society to advance beyond societies neglecting large parts of their population in e.g. education and participation in skilled jobs;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) A more egalitarian society is not only more pleasant to live in but more secure, with less conflict and violence - again, giving an advantage to a more inclusive society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this position, I'd argue that any realistic prediction about the future rights of intelligent AI (i.e., talking about what likely &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; happen instead of a theoretical discussion about what &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; happen) depends on how these two factors apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we believe that the intelligent AI will be constructed so that (1) it's motivation doesn't really depend on it's rights, and it is fully committed to it's &quot;job&quot; anyway, and (2) &quot;full rights&quot; are orthogonal or even actively not desired by it's goal system, so the situation doesn't raise a risk of &quot;rebellion&quot; - then I'd expect that it would not be granted full rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we believe that the intelligent AI will share human-like emotions (e.g. by being the result of &quot;mind uploading&quot; or full human brain simulation), then it's likely to eventually be granted full rights because of the same factors why we granted full rights to all the different disenfranchised groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1675" LastActivityDate="2016-12-19T02:50:26.533" CommentCount="1" />

Self awareness is not among them.  From a cognitive science perspective, self awareness is not a desire but rather trait of consciousness.  The plausible explanations for its presence ranges between the extremes of a completely useless artifact of mental evolution to a deliberate infusion from some supreme entity, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other desires, traits, and capabilities listed in the question are easier to discuss in a way that is backed by existing cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and self-evident human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regulating and prioritizing may an important element in intelligence beyond problem solving.  For instance, a sense of purpose is only a desire as one moves up the hierarchlistedny of needs.  People running from a Mammoth have no interest in purpose.

We already understand what placing a number of such agents on a problem queue produces.  A time sharing computer is exactly of that architecture.  Parallel computing is not a significant deviation from that model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of the current extensions of automation architectures from Bell Labs, Harvard U, MIT, or other historical centers of electronic brain and robotic research and development have produced anything close to the varied integrated capabilities of a biologically healthy, socially aware, motivated human brain functioning as one of the controlling elements within a human body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do, however, have machines with human-like capabilities (simulations of task that were once manual), and such devices sometimes out-perform humans. But none of the existing automation is so integrated that they would blend in with humans.

I recommend every AI practitioner is familiar with the notion of Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms. ML is often related to search algorithms but the techniques they use can vary heavily from iterative building of a classifier/regression (e.g. C4.5 builds a decision tree), meta-heuristics as you noted, and classifiers/regression that are statically generated from analysis of training data (e.g. Naive Bayesian is literally a classifier built on Bayesian analysis of the given data assuming that input fields are independent - this is the 'naivety' from which it gets its name). Often ML algorithms are developed in AI research groups and can sometimes be designed for specific problems instead of being general form algorithms. In contrast to the general field of AI, which is often centered on Intelligence problems and is therefore (in my view) vulnerable to too much blue sky thinking, ML is applied to all sorts of real life problems and is often very practical in its design and performance driven in its evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1467" LastActivityDate="2016-12-21T11:53:34.983" CommentCount="0" />

We all share a common biological background, our behavior, emotions and especially positive/negative feelings arise from the particular way how our brains are built. Man is by nature a social animal, and much of our behavior and feelings of empathy, compassion, fairness, greed, social status, etc are formed and expressed in society. Our minds are adjusted for this, as are the minds of other mammals. A human that forms an ethical system when joining a civil society does so in the basis of all this shared context, and within the limitations of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, all this is orthogonal to intelligence. All the variety of mankind encompasses a tiny island in the whole space of possible intelligences and their goals. Any system of ethics is feasible, a vast majority of them having no relationship whatsoever to what we could consider ethical. A human can be expected to join a society and learn ethics because our brain is hardwired to respond to social stimuli - an AI would learn ethics from a society only if its previous ethics already happen to value that highly, and that isn't likely to happen without careful design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a thought experiment that is commonly used as an example - the &quot;paperclip maximizer&quot;, an artificial agent with an ethical system that defines 'good' proportionally to the number of paperclips that exist in the universe and only that - and that is a &lt;em&gt;perfectly reasonable&lt;/em&gt; example, because a completely random ethical system is overwhelmingly likely to reduce to something stupid like that. The space of &quot;reasonable&quot; (to us) ethical systems is very tiny compared to all ethical systems possible, and expecting that a randomly selected ethical system will just happen to land there is like relying on winning a high-stakes lottery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;We want their ethics to contain certain things&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the main reason why we are studying AGI ethics is because we (or some of us) really, really, want the AGI ethical system to include certain things. For example, I'd like that ethical system to include my survival. I'd prefer that ethical system to be consistent with my happiness and wellbeing - and the very existence of a very powerful entity that simply happens to not care about me at all is not compatible with my survival and wellbeing, so I'd &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; prefer for it to care about me, or alternatively never become very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could certainly argue that we have no right to constitute ethics, rules and morale for another society which could be much more intelligent and better than us. That another society might be &quot;better&quot; in some manner - but better &lt;em&gt;for whom&lt;/em&gt; ? If it's better for &quot;them&quot; but worse for me (and humanity), then I have strong motivation to simply &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; that right and try my hardest to ensure that this hypothetical future society includes me, my desires and my ethics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1675" LastActivityDate="2016-12-22T01:18:30.860" CommentCount="0" />

For fun, lets extend your problem to a much harder case, continuous variables, and see how we deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mood: range [-1, 1]   // 1 is Happy, 0 is Neutral, -1 is Sad&#xA;&#xA;Hunger: range [0, 1]  // 0 is Very Hungry, 1 is Full&#xA;&#xA;Food: range [0, 100] // amount of food, capping at 100 for numbers sake&#xA;&#xA;Time of day: [0, 23] // Hours, 9.5 would be 9:30 am&#xA;&#xA;Position x: range [-10, 10] // assuming the area the agent stays in is 10x10 km&#xA;&#xA;Position y: range [-10, 10]&#xA;&#xA;Money: range [0, 2000]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now its impossible to even count the number of states the agent could be in. An example of one state would be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mood, Hunger, Food, Time, PosX, PosY, Money&#xA;.5, .3, 67.4, 4.5, 0, 0, 5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would mean that our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars. Which has happened to me once or twice before too so this is reasonable. &lt;strong&gt;If we we still wanted to generate a transition matrix and a reward matrix we would have to represent this state uniquely from other possibly similar states such as if the time was 5 pm with all other things equal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now how would we approach this?&#xA;First lets discretize or breakup each range into little chunks. Then we could have an array of 0s representing our chunks and assign a 1 to the index of the chunk we are in. Lets call this array our feature array. &#xA;If we did this for each dimension of our state information, we would end up with some state similar to what you originally proposed. I've chosen some arbitrary numbers to break up the state space and lets see what it does to the example state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we broke the Mood range up into 8 chunks of .25 we would have these ranges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;m = Mood&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-1.0 ≤ m &amp;lt; -.75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-.75 ≤ m &amp;lt; -.50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-.50 ≤ m &amp;lt; -.25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;-.25 ≤ m &amp;lt; 0.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;0.0 ≤ m &amp;lt; .25&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.25 ≤ m &amp;lt; .50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.50 ≤ m &amp;lt; .75&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;.75 ≤ m &amp;lt; 1.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we took the mood from the example state (.5), it would land in the 7th range, so then our feature vector for mood would look like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] &amp;lt;- represents a mood of .5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lets do the same for hunger by splitting it into 8 chunks of .125:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] &amp;lt;- represents a hunger of .3&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could then do something similar for each other state variable and break each state variable's range up into 8 chunks of equal sizes as well. Then after calculating their feature vectors, we would concatenate them all together and have a feature vector that is 56 elements long (7 state variables * 8 chunks each).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this would give us 2^56 different combinations of feature vectors, it actually doesn't represent what we wanted to represent. We need features that activate (are 1) when events happen together. We need a feature that is 1 when we are hungry &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; when we have food. We could do this by doing a cross product of our 56 element feature vector with itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a 3136 element feature vector that has features like:&#xA;  1 if its 3pm and am happy&#xA;  1 if am full and out of food&#xA;  1 if at coordinate -3, 4 (Position x, Position y)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a step in the right direction but still isn't enough to represent or original example state. So lets keep going with the cross products!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we do 6 cross products we would have 30,840,979,456 features and only 1 of them would be on when our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point you are probably like &quot;Well.. thats a bit much&quot;, to which I would agree. This would be the curse of dimensionality, and is the reason transition tables stop being fun (if they ever were).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead lets take a different approach&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than trying to represent an individual state with an individual feature and saying whether that feature is good, lets go back to our nice 56 element feature vector. From here lets instead give a weight (w_i) to each of our 56 features. We have now entered the world of linear function approximation. Although I could explain it here, I think its better explained in Chapter 9 of the Introduction of Reinforcement Learning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4398" LastEditorUserId="4398" LastEditDate="2017-01-10T03:30:29.247" LastActivityDate="2017-01-10T03:30:29.247" CommentCount="1" />

Nothing even close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If such a system exists in secrecy, someone would have to violate their nondisclosure agreement or security clearance to tell us about it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The definition of intelligence is central to answering.  For instance, some reasonable definitions of intelligence might lead an unbiased judge to rate ants above humans.  Ants had been building in hexagons for millennia before humans blundered into the habit of building in rectangles.  Rectangles require over 70% more building material to build vertical structure per square foot of floor space than a packed hexagonal structure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Artificial Intelligence System Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guessing that by, &quot;Basic AI,&quot; you mean some naive machine learning, there are a few basic components.  (The term Naive in this context means that the AI does not understand the domain or the meanings of symbols or signals it is processing in the way a human who had studied or worked within the field might understand them.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENSING &amp;mdash; The machine (computer) must receive information, generally as a time series.  In human beings, these are the senses.  In a mail sorter, it may be a camera.  This is beyond just the concept of input in information technology.  It is more analogous to an input signal in a PID controller.  In an automated high speed trading machine, this would be the high speed version of a ticker tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROL &amp;mdash; The machine must manipulate externals in a way that exploits the received information.  In a basketball player, this is the motor coordination, facial affect, verbal signals to teammates, and perhaps some verbal bait for opposing players.  In a mail sorter, this would be the motor control of mail direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEMORY &amp;mdash; The machine must have storage to audit input time series (perhaps from some transducer in the real world or some data store upon which some intelligent analysis or transformation must be done).  In more advanced systems, the machine may wish to analyze its own performance and make adjustments that converge on some optimal metric value (perhaps a historical maxima or minima) or some range of acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FEEDBACK &amp;mdash; The machine must interpret some feedback signalling or use a predetermined scoring mechanism.  Learning cannot occur in an information vacuum, so some definition of better or worse must be established.  The feedback may be entangled within the SENSING channels or may arrive through a completely separate channel. In biological systems, these are often pre-wired as threat detection, pain, and pleasure.  The cerebral cortex uses concepts of goals and progress.  In some ways, child rearing and social strata exists to teach the boundaries of what constitutes an acceptable goal and acceptable methods for making progress toward it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MODELLING &amp;mdash; Whether implicitly or explicitly, some model must be developed and exploited.  Some would say that the existence of a model upon which the predictive capabilities of it can be applied to decision making to achieve some goal or weighted collection of goals is intelligence.  Others would say that the development of the model is intelligence and the use of it is merely control mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approaches to Simulating Human Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cognition is not the only form of model making, but the creation of cognitions and their application to decision making.  The concept of intelligence may have been furthered along a realistic path by Roger Schank, who proposed that the storage and indexing of stories was a primary characteristics of what humans recognize as intelligent conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minsky and others took a direction that was more connected with logical inference work that began with logic formalization (originally George Boole) and Church's lambda calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Common Directions in Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The genetic algorithm influenced convergent technology and neuro-biology influenced neural net development.  Pattern matching is another limb off the larger set of technical approaches under the umbrella of classic Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are naive systems.  Like a neuron, the components have no idea of the meaning of what they are processing.  They are naive components.  An intelligent observer could not ascertain the real time meanings of signals and symbols between these naive components without extensive, perhaps life-long research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naive Bayesian methods are probabilistic in nature.  They exploit Bayes' Theorem, and have been found to produce excellent results in certain important domains.  Some studies have shown that naivety is actually a learning accelerant, which is interesting from an AI theory point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is fuzzy (weighted) logic, which was an attempt to merge neural nets with production (rule based) systems.  Attempts to use this technology in transportation routing and scheduling has met much success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are as many devices and architectures that attempt to effectively integrate or interconnect these various approaches as there are AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modelling Environment and Goal Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these systems, in some explicit or implicit way, model the external environment and the desired result of system behavior and attempt to converge (in real time) on that result.  Some sense-control functionality, which may change and adapt to the external environment is employed in the CONTROL component(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is just another way that the systems have an adaptive behavior.  Without necessarily knowing why, the system will manipulate what it can and continue to monitor the state of the environment to continually reach for the system's acceptance criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Basic AI system must to more than learn.  It must also judge its own functionality and therefore must have a layer of feedback and control that simulates the perception of optimality.  This higher level control must be integrated into the system at its inception for it to behave intelligently in the sense you probably mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Limitation and System Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more sophisticated and adaptive the modelling becomes, the more the cognitions, rules, stories, time series coefficients, weights, or whatever forms knowledge (not information) is stored, the more one can say that there is some form of understanding or comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One conjecture is that it is the recursion in layers of these capabilities that permits certain types of comprehension and awareness.

Set theory, model theory, things of that nature come into play.

Secondly, how does the system, once it extract all of the necessary information on the input, determine what action it needs to take and what to say back to the user? lastly, it also states that the system can learn habits and preferences of the user, how can a system do this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvimBPJ3XGQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is also a video of the AI in action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4532" LastActivityDate="2016-12-31T07:49:40.360" Title="Making a simple ai like Jarvis" Tags="&lt;neural-networks&gt;&lt;machine-learning&gt;&lt;deep-learning&gt;&lt;conv-neural-network&gt;&lt;nlp&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="1" />

Two systematic approaches are to start very simple and make the model more complicated, or start complicated and make your model simpler (or just normalize a lot). Look at the performance on the training set and on a separate validation set during training. If the model keeps on improving on the training data but starts to deteriorate on the validation data, you're probably over fitting. In this case you should either make the model simpler (fewer nodes, fewer layers) or regularize (start with l2 normalization on the weights). If the data doesn't perform well on the training data, you may wish to make the model more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've tried the feedforward network, really do try CNN or RNNs for this task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4480" LastActivityDate="2017-01-02T13:31:52.200" CommentCount="1" />

The research paper you're interested in is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irc.atr.jp/~drazen/pdf/HRI2015_Brscic.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Escaping from Children’s Abuse of Social Robots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that research paper, researchers were able to program the robots to follow a planning simulation to reduce the probability of abuse by children. If it detects children, the robot is programmed to retreat into a crowd of adults (who can then discipline the children if needed). This happened because the researchers saw that it was only children who were beating up the robots in the mall in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They discuss trying out other options though:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In this work the robot’s strategy to prevent abuse was to “escape”, i.e. move to a location where it is less likely abuse will occur. One could ask why the robot cannot overcome the abuse. In our preliminary trials we have tried several approaches, but we found that it is very difficult for the robot to persuade children not to abuse it. For example, we changed the robot’s wordings in many ways, using strong words, emotional or polite expressions, but none of them were successful. One partially successful strategy was the robot ‘physically’ pushing children. When its way was blocked, it would just try to keep going and behave as if it will collide into children and force its way through (under careful monitoring from a human operator). We observed that children at first accepted the robot’s requests and obeyed them; but, very soon they learned that they are stronger than the robot so they can win if they push, and also that they can stop it by pushing the bumper switch (attached on the robot for safety). After realizing that, they just continued with the abusive behavior. Obviously having a stronger robot would present a problem for safety and social acceptance so dealing with such abusive situations remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But let's interrogate your question further:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If conscious AI is possible and is wide spread, wouldn't it be easy for someone who knows what they are doing to torture AI? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why would you consider such torture to be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;? After all, one could argue that the machine won't really 'experience' pain if you torture it...so it should be morally okay to torture the machine then. It may be respond as &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; it is in pain, but it's dubious whether the ability to simulate an emotional state such as &quot;being in pain&quot; is equivalent to actually &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; in that emotional state. See the question &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/34779/is-the-simulation-of-emotional-states-equivalent-to-actually-experiencing-emotio/35815&quot;&gt;Is the simulation of emotional states equivalent to actually experiencing emotion?&lt;/a&gt; for more discussion on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make such an argument, but it won't really work on an emotional level because most humans would feel &lt;em&gt;empathy&lt;/em&gt; towards the machine. It may be hard to justify it logically (and it may be based on humans' tendencies to engage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;anthropomorphism&lt;/a&gt;), but we feel this empathy. It's this empathy that caused you to ask this question in the first place, caused researchers to figure out how to protect a robot from being beaten up, enabled police officers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/07/national/crime-legal/drunken-kanagawa-man-60-arrested-after-kicking-softbank-robot-in-fit-of-rage/#.WHj4Rccc9Lp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;arrest a drunken Japanese man for beating up a SoftBank robot&lt;/a&gt;, and made many humans upset over the destruction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;hitchBOT&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; how AI abuse would be avoided - human empathy. If most humans care about the welfare of machines, they'll make it a priority to stop those few humans who are able and willing to abuse the machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The OP has edited his &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; to clarify that he is talking about &lt;em&gt;software&lt;/em&gt;, and not about robots. For robots, you can rely on anthropomorphism to produce some level of sympathy, but it's hard to sympathize with raw lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You're not going to stop abuse of algorithms. Put it frankly, since the algorithms aren't like us, we aren't going to extend the same sort of empathy that we would to robots. Even chatbots are kinda iffy. If you could get people to sympathize with lines of code though (possibly by making a convincing simulation of emotion and sapience), then the above answer applies - humans anthropomorphize the machine and will come up with countermeasures. We aren't that level yet, so &quot;stopping AI abuse&quot; will be a low priority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, some failsafes could be programmed in to limit the damage of abuse, as detailed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chatbots.org/ai_zone/viewthread/1488/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this thread on chatbot abuse&lt;/a&gt; - making the bot respond in a boring manner to make the abuser feel bored and move onto the next target, responding back to the abuser in a &quot;battle of wits&quot;, or even just blocking the abusers from using the service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These failsafes are cold comfort to those that want to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; abuse, not respond to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also...an abuser can happily learn how to program an AI to then abuse to his/her heart's content. Nothing can be done to stop that, and any possible measures to stop said abuse (such as monitoring every human being to make sure they don't program an AI to abuse) will probably cause more damage than it'd solve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="181" LastEditorUserId="181" LastEditDate="2017-01-31T00:59:16.970" LastActivityDate="2017-01-31T00:59:16.970" CommentCount="3" />

It is extremely easy to see that this is wrong, because A* is a search algorithm that guarantees to find an optimal solution given that only admissible heuristics are used. (A heuristic is being admissible if it never over-estimates the optimal goal distance. This is the case in your example.) Since the true cost for reaching G1 is 11 and the true cost for reaching G2 is 13, clearly G1 must be found first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, your expansion order is wrong as well.

Goal nodes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; returned when being created, but when being selected for expansion! So, although the expansion of D generates G2, you are not allowed to return G2 as solution, because it has not been selected for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Can G2 be found as well?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;NietzscheanAI&lt;/em&gt; pointed out, you can simple continue search.

But, we know that this is just not all. Turing Test has not much to offer when it comes to what AI is in a general sense.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Turing Test, as the Wikipedia states, was created to test machines exhibiting behaviour equivalent or indistinguishable from that of a human. Artificial Intelligence is much more than what humans can do or how they act. There are many human acts that are considered unintelligent and sometimes inhuman too.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Chinese Room Argument&lt;/a&gt; focuses on something every important when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Consciousness v/s Simulation of Consciousness&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. John Searle argued there that it is possible for a machine (or human) to follow a huge number of predefined rules (algorithm), in order to complete the task, without thinking or possessing the mind. Weak AIs are good at simulating the ability to understand but, don't really understand what they are doing. They don't exhibit &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Self-Awareness&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and don't form representation about themselves. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I want that v/s I know I want that&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; are two different things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As Theory of Mind states that a good AI should not just form representation about the world it is working on, but also about other agents and entities in the world. This two concepts of &lt;em&gt;self-awareness and theory of mind&lt;/em&gt; draw a thin line between weak and strong AI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When it comes to the Turing Test, it fails on many grounds and so does the Total Turing Test, which adds another layer to the test. Most of the researchers believe that Turing Test is just a distraction from the main goal, something that hinders them from fruitful work. Consider this, suppose you ask a difficult arithmetic problem in order to distinguish between human and machine. If the machine wants to pretend it is human then it will lie. This is not what we want. Going for the Turing Test sets the upper bound to the AI that can be created. Also making AI act and behave like humans is not a very good idea. Humans are not very good at making right decisions all the time. This is the reasons why we read about wars in our history books. Decisions which we make are often biased, have selfish origins, etc. We don't want an AI to come with all those things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don't think there is one test to test an AI. This is because AI has many definitions, many types. Whether an AI is weak or strong can be tagged while looking for answers to questions like, &quot;I want that v/s I know I want that&quot;, &quot;Who am I and what exactly I am doing (from machine's perspective)&quot;, plus some other questions I mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3005" LastActivityDate="2017-01-23T14:21:49.407" CommentCount="0" />

Take an example of Tic Tac Toe. If you are designing an intelligent computer player for this, then what you will do is that you will form a search space and then you will search for most optimal move which can be made to conclude the game. In these, scenarios you must be aware of optimal search strategies. Let's take another example, suppose if you are driving and want to got to an unknown person's house. It's far from your place and you decide to use GPS. Your GPS will use search algorithms to find the most optimal route that you can take to reach to the destination (of course there will be lots of factors to consider like traffic, etc. but this is the basic idea).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages are only in terms of processing and storage. For slow algorithms you will be wasting lots of CPU time and storage as well but for good and efficient algorithms, you can preserve lots of space and also execute your task very fast. Of course, just learning about searching isn't AI.

The algorithms employed rely heavily on Bayesian network and the theorem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The given paragraph is introduction to Bayesian networks, given in the book, Artificial Intelligence – A Modern Approach:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Bayesian network formalism was invented to allow efficient representation of, and rigorous reasoning with, uncertain knowledge. This approach largely overcomes many problems of the probabilistic reasoning systems to the 1960s and 70s; it now dominates AI research on uncertain reasoning and expert systems. The approach allows for learning from experience, and it combines the best of classical AI and neural nets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many other applications, especially in medical science. Like predicting a particular disease based on the symptoms and physical condition of the patient. There are many algorithms currently in use that are based on this theorem, like binary and multi-class classifier, for example, email spam filters.&#xA;There are many things in this topic, I will advise you to keep our essay precise and one topic oriented.

I've read as much as I can on the subject (that I can grasp) and believe I understand all the broad concepts and some of the workings (despite being very weak in maths), neurons, synapses, weights, cost functions, backpropagation etc. However, I've not been able to figure out how to translate real world problems into a neural network solution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Case in point, Adam Geitgey gives as an example usage, a house price prediction system where given a data set containing &lt;strong&gt;No. of bedrooms&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sq. feet&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Neighborhood&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sale price&lt;/strong&gt; you can train a neural network to be able to predict the price of a house. However he stops short of actually implementing a possible solution in code. The closest he gets, by way of an example, is basic a function demonstrating how you'd implement weights:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood):&#xA;  price = 0&#xA;&#xA;  # a little pinch of this&#xA;  price += num_of_bedrooms * 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  # and a big pinch of that&#xA;  price += sqft * 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  # maybe a handful of this&#xA;  price += neighborhood * 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure&#xA;  price += 1.0&#xA;&#xA;  return price &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other resources seem to focus more heavily on the maths and the only basic code example I could find that I understand (i.e. that isn't some all singing, all dancing image classification codebase) is an implementation that trains a neural network to be an XOR gate that deals only in 1's and 0's.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there's a gap in my knowledge that I just can't seem to bridge. If we return to the &lt;strong&gt;house price prediction&lt;/strong&gt; problem, hows does one make the data suitable for feeding into a neural network? For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No. of bedrooms: 3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sq. feet: 2000&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Neighborhood: Normaltown&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sale price: $250,000&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can you just feed &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2000&lt;/strong&gt; directly into the neural network because they are numbers? Or do you need to transform them into something else? Similarly what about the &lt;strong&gt;Normaltown&lt;/strong&gt; value, that's a string, how do you go about translating it into a value a neural network can understand? Can you just pick a number, like an index, so long as it's consistent throughout the data?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the neural network examples I've seen the numbers passing between layers are either 0 to 1 or -1 to 1.

If your data is not well-behaved (i.e. fraught with outliers) then you may need to do more work normalizing the inputs and outputs. Some of the more advanced methods are described &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~wylin/BA/Fusion_of_Biometrics_II.ppt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I will assume that you are using f(x) = tanh(x) as your activation function. If you aren't, you should still be able to reason through how to normalize your data after reading this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prepare the input data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that you want a significant variation in each input parameter to be reflected by a significant variation in the activation of the neuron those inputs are being fed into. By looking at a plot of the derivative of the tanh(x) actiavtion function, you'll see that the region of significant slope is within a distance of one or two from the origin. This means that whether the input to the activation function is 2000 or 3000 (values of x for which the derivative is negligibly small), the output of the activation will be almost identical...so your neuron's state will be independent of the difference between 2000 and 3000, and your network will never produce any predictive power from values in that range. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to input the square footage of the house into a neuron, you need to &lt;em&gt;normalize&lt;/em&gt; the square footage so that the network can tell the difference between 2000 and 3000. One way to do this so that all of the significant variations in your data are 'noticed' by the neuron is to &lt;strong&gt;z-score-normalize the inputs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather all of your square footage values (from your training set) and calculate the mean and standard deviation. &lt;em&gt;Store the mean and standard deviation&lt;/em&gt;---you'll need this information to normalize new square footage values when testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalize the vector of square footage values by subtracting the mean and then dividing the result by the standard deviation&lt;/strong&gt; (all operations element-wise of course). Subtracting the mean centers your data at the origin, and dividing by the standard deviation makes sure most of it is between -1 and 1, where the neuron's output is most sensitive to its input. This is called z-score normalization because each input value is replaced by its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;z-score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the above for each input variable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, when you put each input value through a neuron, the output of the neuron is an activation between -1 and 1 (look at the image of tanh(x)). Since this is already in the 'sensitive' range of the activation function, you don't need to worry about altering the output of the input-layer neurons before sending them to the first hidden layer. Just &lt;strong&gt;give any hidden layer neurons the outputs of the previous layer directly&lt;/strong&gt;---they will be able to handle them just fine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you reach the last layer (the output neuron(s)), what you get is again another activation between -1 and 1. You have to convert this back into a value for the house in question&lt;/strong&gt;, whether that value will be used as a prediction in a test set or to calculate error during training. However you do this, you just have to be consistent and use the same de-normalization procedure in training and testing. One way to think about it is: when the output neuron(s) returns 1, that means the network is returning the &lt;em&gt;maximum possible house value&lt;/em&gt; as its prediction. &lt;em&gt;What should the highest value the network can estimate be?&lt;/em&gt; The right approach here simply depends on your application. This is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the mean of [the/each] output variable and store it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the maximum deviation of the output variable from the mean. &#xA;Python: &lt;code&gt;MaxDev = max([abs(DataPoint-numpy.mean(TrainingData)) for DataPoint in TrainingData])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the network returns output(s) between -1 and 1, multiply the output by &lt;code&gt;MaxDev&lt;/code&gt; and add it to the mean.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two basic quick checks you can do to see if your normalization-renormalization scheme is suitable (these are necessary, but perhaps not sufficient conditions):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If all the input values are average (e.g. average no. of bedrooms, average sq.feet, etc), is the network's output equal to the average of the output variable (e.g. house value) as well? (It should be.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If all the input values are unusually high/low, is the network's output unusually high/low as well? (This only works if all the inputs are positively related to the output...if some of them are inversely related related, you will have to think a bit more).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observe that the scheme presented here satisfies these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notice that this scheme would allow your network to only predict house values &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the range of house values in your training data set. Depending on the application, this behavior can be desirable or undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example: you may want to make it impossible for your network to predict negative house values. Think about how you would do this. De-normalize the output so that -1 is mapped to 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to set no limit on the values your network can predict, then you can run the network's output through a function that maps the [-1,1] range to all real numbers...like arctanh(x)! As long as you do this during training your network will adjust its weights to accommodate this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have further questions. My ANN module is in Python, by the way, so I might have language-specific advice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5037" LastActivityDate="2017-02-08T08:45:44.100" CommentCount="5" />

For instance, a model represents a certain part of the reality. Imagine a cup on a table. If the agent has a representation of this situation, it has a symbol &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; and a symbol &lt;code&gt;cup&lt;/code&gt; which represents the things in the real world. Now it can have a relation &lt;code&gt;on(cup, table)&lt;/code&gt; which represents the situation that the cup is on the table. This type of abstraction can be easily represented in a logic language like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If.E2.80.93then.28.E2.80.93else.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;first order logic&lt;/a&gt;.

That is not meant with representation. Brooks' Creatures have only this information and calculate with this data directly to perform an action without reasoning. In that sense also artificial neural networks have no representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, for an open source project to understand representation I would recommend the above mentioned OWL.

Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer/software program[intelligent Agent].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robot Vision &amp;amp; Machine Vision(intelligent vision)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robot Vision involves using a combination of camera hardware and computer algorithms to allow robots to process visual data from the world. For example, your system could have a 2D camera which detects an object for the robot to pick up. A more complex example might be to use a 3D stereo camera to guide a robot to mount wheels onto a moving vehicle.Just like Google's self driving Car. And remember robot vision is closely related to Machine Vision(though Machine Vision refers to the industrial use of vision for automatic inspection, process control).&#xA;Without Robot Vision, your robot is essentially blind. This is not a problem for many robotic tasks, but for some applications Robot Vision is useful or even essential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where it starts to get a little more complex is when we include Pattern Recognition into the family tree, or more broadly Machine Learning. This branch of the family is focused on recognising patterns in data, which is quite important for many of the more advanced functions required of Robot Vision. For example, to be able to recognise an object from its image, the software must be able to detect if the object it sees is similar to previous objects. Machine Learning, therefore, is another parent of Computer Vision alongside Signal Processing/image processing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, not all Computer Vision techniques require Machine Learning. You can also use Machine Learning on signals which are not images. In practice, the two domains are often combined like this: Computer Vision technique can detect features and information from an image, which are then used as an input to the Machine Learning algorithms. For example, Computer Vision technique detects the size and color of parts on a conveyor belt, then Machine Learning decides if those parts are faulty based on its learned knowledge about what a good part should look like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are such methods/techniques being used or worked on today?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow and head of Brain team that just put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; machine learning library into open source, gave the opening day keynote on deep learning, a powerful class of machine learning that allows machines to understand what they are seeing. These algorithms are trained by exposing them to huge amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example. 1000’s of tagged pictures of a car or people or animals, so they learn to recognize an unknown similar image very accurately, even if the object is somewhat obscured. They are now even able to interpret context. It’s not just a picture of a “baby”, but the algorithm comes back with “A baby is asleep next to a teddy bear”. it's therefore,quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So,according to such scenario;you can analyse critically and guess what technique is applied! and real progress is made on this;don't forget that these are millions invested in these projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gestalt Processing,inline with it's application(research with progress)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Advertisers are using the basic gestalt process in the television medium focus on how the viewer responds to the entire message for instance the sounds, colors and distinct images seen in the commercial. The response varies from viewer to viewer, depending on age, emotional background, physical condition, level of education and social class. How the individual responds is his gestalt. Depending on the product or service, advertisers target the message to specific viewer demographics, who share common gestalt responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Similarity Principle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When conducting an ad campaign, marketers use the gestalt processing when reducing the product to a basic design theme, logo or slogan. Think of famous ad lines or instantly-recognizable symbols, such as McDonald's golden arches. That symbol evokes hamburgers and french fries to anyone remotely familiar with advertising, although the logo itself does not display food. Advertisers strive for individuality when marketing products, so the viewer or customer doesn't confuse their product with a competitor's item. However, under gestalt principles, customers won't confuse completely different products, such as cars and food, or clothes and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perception&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In advertising, perception is reality. Advertisers using gestalt principles must consider how the message they use is perceived by potential customers and how this message prompts action -- buying the product or service. Media and advertising professionals use gestalt theory to create effective ways to sell products whether using images or conceiving of the most beneficial forms of distribution. Figuring the overall success rate of using gestalt principles is also based in simplicity -- sales results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore;according to such scenario,companies like Amazoon,IBM,Google to mention but a few a have applied all the above methods or techniques and are still booming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-02-09T14:31:44.300" CommentCount="0" />

If it's roughly 10, it might be iambic pentameter. The AI doesn't care about the label, but it likes 10.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;20 syllables might represent a couplet in that meter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The time is out of joint, oh cursed spite&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;that ever I was born to set it right&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd definitely start by feeding it older poetry, particularly poets that keep to strict meter. It's been a while since I've read Spencer and so forth, but I'd think poets of his time would be useful.  Dr. Seuss, perhaps the greatest wielder of the rhyming couplet, would surely be extraordinarily useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evaluation method would have to be fuzzy, because there would be increasing degrees of variance the more modern the poetry, ultimately resulting in free structures, except in the case of forms such as rap, which strongly utilize regularized rhythm. Machine learning is all about estimation and reinforcement, and is proving to be extremely useful dealing with fuzziness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;is a great example of modern line of poetry: the floor of 13 syllables / 2 makes a 6 beat line.  Understanding that in context with the surrounding verse is much more difficult and illustrates the nature of the problem. Even scanning the poem correctly to that point to determine would be extremely difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, a different poem by the same author is extremely useful:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the late November doing / With the disturbance of the spring / And creatures of the summer heat, / And snowdrops writhing under feet / And hollyhocks that aim too high / Red into grey and tumble down / Late roses filled with early snow? / Thunder rolled by the rolling stars / Simulates triumphal cars / Deployed in constellated wars / Scorpion fights against the sun / Until the Sun and Moon go down / Comets weep and Leonids fly / Hunt the heavens and the plains / Whirled in a vortex that shall bring / The world to that destructive fire / Which burns before the ice-cap reigns&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All lines of roughly 8 syllables, easy to pick out because of capitalization.  But the real question is: ~136 13 lines of roughly 10 syllables, or 17 lines of roughly 8?  It would want to calculate based on word blocks (words that cross syllabic thresholds and at least tell you where the break &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be, and it should be possible to statistically divine the pattern, at least for regularized verse.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The wounded surgeon plies the steel / That questions the distempered part; /&#xA;  Beneath the bleeding hands we feel / The sharp compassion of the healer's art &#xA;  / Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This verse highlight the problem.  5 lines of 4 beats, but syllabically: 8, 8, 8, 10, 12.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/5 = 9.2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/4 = 11.5&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/6 = 7.66&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less likely:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/3 = 15.3&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/2 = 23  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;46/7 = 6.57&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 lines has less perfect symmetry, but 5 lines is more likely, based on the overall number of syllables, and of the likely choices, has the least variance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it would be looking for the underlying structure, or lack of structure, and try to reorganize the unbroken text into something &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to the original structure.  While exactness is not always required because the process is ultimately subjective, and currently intractable, certain wrong choices would yield disastrous results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the prior example it may be able to discern the likelihood of a 5 line pattern, but it would have to figure out on which lines to place the extra syllables.  Differentiating between particles and other parts of speech provides a clue, because the poet's language is very compact: there are 19 nouns, verbs, or prepositions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More likely:&#xA; - 19/5 = 3.8&#xA; - 19/4 = 4.75&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Less likely:&#xA; - 19/3 = 6.33&#xA; - 19/6 = 3.16&#xA; - 19/7 = 2.71&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis might narrow it down.  But extremely regularized verse remains the best place to start.  7 lines of roughly 10 syllables is &quot;poetic&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;‘The aged man that coffers-up his gold&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Is plagu’d with cramps and gouts and painful fits;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  And useless barns the harvest of his wits;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Having no other pleasure of his gain&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  But torment that it cannot cure his pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It cares about both X and Y values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially you want to keep it to a single language, because syllables may be treated differently.  That said, having the AI look for something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dactylic hexameter&lt;/a&gt; would be extremely useful, because you could feed it Homer. You could also feed it Homer in English in many different forms of English meter, and in almost every other living language. By definition, the AI would value works such as these, because max number_of_translations provides the most robust data set. When it starts to value meaning, this will be especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding different ways of treating syllables(long/short vs. stressed/unstressed) will also be essential as it transitions into more modern poetry.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/meter.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here is a good link for basic English meter.&lt;/a&gt;  Iambic and Trochaic meters will be easy, while meters that employ Anapests, Dactyls and Spondees will be more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, however, these will be mathematically interchangeable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I went to the Garden of Love, / And saw what I never had seen: / A Chapel was built in the midst, / Where I used to play on the green. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter if the lines above are iambic/trochaic or dactylic/anapestic, it's still 4 lines of roughly 8 syllables.  Thus &quot;I went to the Garden of Love&quot; is the same as &quot;The wounded surgeon plies the steel&quot;, even though the beats for the lines are 3 and 4, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should also have a stanza marker, (possibly 00?). Because it looks for patterns within patterns, stanzas are valued.  Not all poetry has a stanza structure, but it arguably could. Deciding if stanzas are appropriate is partly a function of taking a syllabic divisor, breaking the poem down into number_of_lines, and looking at the divisors of that number. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would need an added function to be able to recognize meaning patterns.  For instance, repetition of proper nouns is the marker of plays. (From a meaning perspective, imo, plays is the ideal place to start because the marker is so easy to learn, and names all belong to a single set, and imply communication. It's no different functionally than any other identifier, and a concept all computers &quot;understand&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually it would want to look for phonetic patterns, rhymes and near rhymes, which would also be indicators of potential good places for line breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a very big data set that it can look at, and who knows what it might discern?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1671" LastEditorUserId="1671" LastEditDate="2017-02-19T21:55:04.943" LastActivityDate="2017-02-19T21:55:04.943" CommentCount="0" />

The idea was to get away from the 1980's popular approach of a single global representation of all the components of the problem space that had required the task of robot task planning to juggle every  constraint in the world into one giant disordered mess of states and state transitions.  Rather than represent every element in the world in a single model (The Representation), Brooks suggested it was preferable to build a hierarchy of submodels of the world (subsets of states and transitions) in which smaller tasks could be more readily planned.  Then as these rudimentary skills were mastered, they could be combined to address a hierarchy of bigger and more complex tasks (bigger tasks subsume smaller tasks and benefit from their already having been solved).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, representation did not fully go away, but it was redistributed hierarchically so that much of the state could be abstracted away from the higher level of the bigger problem that you need to solve.  Planning became like coordinating a hierarchical army of skills, where the general doesn't need to plan every movement of the private in order to manage a battle.  Instead, that general need only tell the colonels what to do, and the colonels tell the majors, and so on down to the privates.  Now the general solves problems by coodinating multiple sub-hierarchies available to him/her by delegating authority to coordinate behavior at the appropriate level of abstraction: like division, brigade, battalion, company, and squad.  That's Brooks' Subsumption Architecure: the general needs to represent a battle plan only as &quot;the world according to colonels&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1657" LastActivityDate="2017-02-16T04:58:06.970" CommentCount="0" />

It quotes I.J. Good, who wrote in 1965:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultrainteltigent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an &quot;intelligence explosion,&quot; and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligeat machine is the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later on in the textbook, you have this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;26.7 - I. J. Good claims that intelligence is the most important quality, and that building ultraintelligent machines will change everything. A sentient cheetah counters that &quot;Actually speed is more important; if we could build ultrafast machines, that would change everything&quot; and a sentient elephant claims &quot;You're both wrong; what we need is ultrastrong machines,&quot; What do you think of these arguments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the textbook question is an implicit argument against I.J. Good. Good may be treating intelligence as valuable, simply because man's strengths lies in that trait called &quot;intelligence&quot;. But other traits could be equally valued instead (speed or strength) and sentient beings may speculate wildly about their preferred traits being &quot;maximized&quot; by some machine or another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder whether a singularity could occur if we had built machines that were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; maximizing intelligence, but instead maximizing some other trait (a machine that is always increasing its strength, or a machine that is always increasing its speed). These types of machines can be just as transformative - ultrafast machines may solve problems quickly due to &quot;brute force&quot;, and ultrastrong machines can use its raw power for a variety of physical tasks. Perhaps a ultra-X machine can't build another ultra-X machine (as I.J. Good treated the design of machines as an intellectual activity), but a continually self-improving machine would still leave its creators far behind and force its creators to be dependent on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, let's repeat my question -- Are technological singularities limited to ultra-intelligences?

That's pretty obvious because neurons die all the time, but we don't wake up and have forgotten how to recognise the letter 'A'. In fact we have to take out rather big chunks of the neocortex until functionality degrades, which is why Alzheimer's patients show symptoms only when the brain is already visibly messed up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translational invariance within a level of the hierarchy has to be learned. Basically you need filters for the same edge all over your V1. An object moving across your field of vision only becomes invariant in it's representation on a higher level. Unfortunately we don't magically learn a representation that we can easily turn and twist, our ability to recognise objects from an unusual angle degrades with how uncommon the angle is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A nice thought experiment to illustrate the point: Imagine a cube sitting in front of you. Now pull one of the corners of the cube upwards until the cube is dangling in front of you, one corner pointing straight to the ceiling, the opposite corner pointing to the ground. Now indicate with your finger where the rest of the corner are. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are anything like me, this is really difficult. I think the first time I did't even realise I had to point out six corners! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this is 3D and we might still have inbuilt 2D invariance, but it also turns out that faces that are turned upside down have to be processed much higher into the cortex to be recognised as faces and so on ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the learning of a lot of different feature vectors across the field of vision: This might be prevented by the fact that the neocortex learns sequences of input by predicting (via depolarisation) the next pattern. So you might have the situation that a higher level tells the lower level that there is an object moving from left to right and the lower level will predict that the edge it is detecting at point y will reoccur at point y+x.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This setup differs from the training of NNs in two ways: The data is already translational and the translation is predicted, which facilitates learning the same features. Basically two pattern recogniser close to each other get pretty much the same pattern one after the other whenever something moves in a certain direction and the second occurrence is predicted, which means it will be more likely detected, which means it will be learned. (I don't want to dole out a lecture about the cortex, but the prediction is a big deal because it allows neurons to fire quicker which means they beat other neurons before they are laterally inhibited and only if they actually fire will they learn.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer I want to add that this is just my current understanding of the issue and I'm pretty sure the actual explanation is more complicated. For example I've read that one of the layers of the cortex is important for translational invariance and this layer only exists in the levels close to the sensory input. It is conjectured that this layer (L4) doesn't do the sequence prediction stuff, so maybe having the same kind of input is enough or learning different feature vectors is not actually a problem. There is also the complicating issue that there is poorly understood interplay between the different layers and different levels of the cortex. I would recommend to ask a neuroscientist, except I don't think they figured this out yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2227" LastActivityDate="2017-02-22T10:11:26.350" CommentCount="2" />

But one way or another, it has to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Non-intelligent species will simply starve and die quietly when there’s insufficient food. &#xA;But intelligent species will form identity groups and hold riots and protests, and eventually go to war. &#xA;These will be the cyclic crisis wars of extermination specified by Generational Dynamics and every intelligent species in the universe will have them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this can give you a glimpse,then just know Artificial Intelligence ain't no joke.....Lets study it hard...so that we see such a future.&#xA;Special Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;StackExchange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1581" LastActivityDate="2017-02-27T11:04:32.917" CommentCount="0" />

Sorry if it's wordy, I'm not sure how to express it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems fairly uncontroversial to say that NN based approaches are becoming quite powerful tools in many AI areas - whether recognising and decomposing images (faces at a border, street scenes in automobiles, decision making in uncertain/complex situations or with partial data)..... almost inevitably some of those uses will develop into situations where NN based AI takes on part or all of the human burden and generally does it better than people generally do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples might include NN hypothetically used as steps in self driving cars, medical diagnosis, human/identity verification, circuit/design verification, dubious transaction alerting ... probably many fields in the next decade or so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose this happens, and is generally seen as successful (eg it gets diagnoses right 80% to human doctors' 65% or something, or cars with AI that includes an NN component crash 8% less than human driven cars or alternatives, or whatever...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now - suppose one of these aberrantly and seriously does something very wrong in one case. How can one approach it? With formal logic steps one can trace a formal decision process, but with NN there may be no formal logic, especially if it gets complex enough (in a couple of decades say), there are just 20 billion neural processors and their I/O weightings and connections, it may not be possible to determine what caused some incident even if lives were lost. It also may not be possible to say more than the systems continually learn and such incidents are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also haven't heard of any meaningful way to do a &quot;black box&quot; or flight recorder equivalent for NNs, (even if not used i  a life critical case), that would allow us to understand and avoid a bad decision. Unlike other responses to product defects, if a NN could be trained after the event to fix one such case, it doesn't clearly provide the certainty we would want, that the new NN setup has fixed the problem, or hasn't reduced the risk and balance of other problems in so doing. It's just very opaque. And yet, clearly, it is mostly very valuable as an AI approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's the answer? Is there one? In 20 years if NN is an (acknowledged as safe and successful) component in a plane flight or aircraft design, or built into a hospital system to watch for emergencies, or to spot fraud at a bank, and has as usual passed whatever regulatory and market requirements might exist and performed with a good record for years in the general marketplace, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; then in one case such a system some time later plainly mis-acts on one occasion - it damgerously misreads the road, recommends life-damaging medications or blatantly missdiagnoses, or clears a blatant £200m fraudulent transaction at a clearing bank that's only caught by chance before the money is sent - what can the manufacturer do to address public or market concerns, or to explain the incident; what do the tech team do when told by the board &quot;how did this happen and make damn sure it's fixed&quot;; what kind of meaningful logs can be kept, etc?

My questions are: 1) is knowledge base(for instance knowledge graph coined by Google) a promising branch in AI? If so, in what ways KB can empower machine learning? And how can it help in natural language generation? 2) for survival in an age dominated by DL where is the direction for the knowledge base? Is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wolfram.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wolfram&lt;/a&gt;-like dynamic knowledge base the new direction? Or any new directions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hoping that I am asking an appropriate question here(I even can not tag my question as &quot;knowledge base&quot; so far). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Am I horribly missing something happening?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5351" LastEditorUserId="5351" LastEditDate="2017-03-10T04:50:27.497" LastActivityDate="2017-03-10T04:50:27.497" Title="I wonder what roles the knowledge base plays now and will play in the future?"

First, let's start with the architecture. A NN has 3 regions, the input layer, the hidden layers and the output layer. The input layer depends on the number of features in your dataset. The hidden layers, you can have multiple layers all of different breadth (number of nodes per layer). The output layer depends on the number of classes in your dataset. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An easy example is applying a NN to the MNIST datatset. This is a dataset which contains handwritten digits between 0-9. Let's assume each of these images is 16*16=256 pixels. Thus, you will need 256 input nodes. And you will need 10 output nodes, one for each possible output. The hidden layers can be set in any way you can creatively imagine. There are however ways to optimize your hidden layer to get the best performance possible while not spending too much computational power. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is always how a NN works. The beauty of a NN is that you only need to code it once and it can learn any function. All you need to do is change your architecture, but the underlining principles will always be the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case, you want to do segmentation. This is often done using a window around the pixel you want to classify. Popular choices are 3*3 or 5*5 pixels. The choice of your considered window will determine the number of nodes in your input layer. Then you want to classify them as one of two classes, thus you need 2 output nodes. You can also use just 1, but I don't recommend it, I can expand on this if you care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One caveat of NN is that you will need quite a bit of training data. So get ready to classify a lot of pixels manually. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to know how many layers in hidden layer? How to know how many nodes per layer in the hidden layer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, for simple operations like the one you are trying to learn you do not need to have multiple layers. One hidden layer should be enough, at most 2. But, how do you determine the number of nodes you should use? You need to use some model validation techniques to do this. One way is through grid search and cross-validation. Train, and re-train your model with multiple number of nodes and then compare their performances to identify the optimal number of nodes. To get good results this does require a large dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb: 1 hidden layer for NN! Don't get dragged into deep models if you don't need them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5925" LastActivityDate="2017-03-09T15:34:17.910" CommentCount="0" />

I'm currently working on the pre-Socratics as the most basic philosophies for first principles (These philosophers are intriguing for their simplicity and universality, and the &quot;dawn of consciousness&quot;, in some conceptions, may be ascribed to the Classical Era.

In that case the choice with a value ten times higher than the value of another choice will be picked ten times as often.
